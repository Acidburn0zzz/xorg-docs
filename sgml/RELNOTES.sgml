<abstract>

These release notes contains information about features and their status in the
X.org Foundation X11R&relvers; release.
It is based on the XFree86 4.4RC2 RELNOTES document published by 
The XFree86&trade; Project, Inc.
There are significant updates and differences in the X.org release
as noted below.
</abstract>

<toc>

<p>
<sect>Introduction to the X11R6.7 Release Series
<p>
The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.
X11 refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window
system is based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been
stable for 15 years, with only upward compatible additions to the
core X protocol, a record of stability envied in computing.
Formal releases of X started with X version 9 from MIT;
the first commercial X products were based on X version 10.
The MIT X Consortium and its successor, the X.org Consortium before the
founding of the X.org Foundation released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6.2.
<p>
X11R&relvers; is based on the 4.4RC2 codebase, with significant updates,
noted below.
<p>
There will be future maintenance releases in the X11R6.7.x series.
However, efforts are well underway to split the X distribution into
its modular components to allow for easier maintenance and independent
updates. We expect a transitional period while both X11R6.7 releases
are being fielded and the modular release completed and deployed while both
will be available as different consumers of X technology have different
constraints on deployment. We have not yet decided how the modular
X releases will be numbered.
<p>
Due to the new XFree86 1.1 license introduced in XFree86 4.4 (final),
later additions to XFree86 may not be incorporated into our codebase.
We encourage you to submit bug fixes and enhancements to bugzilla.freedesktop.org
using the xorg product, and discussions on this server take
place on <email>xorg@freedestkop.org</email>.

<sect>Introduction to the XFree86 4.x Release Series
<p>
XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.
It was based on X11R6.4.
<p>
XFree86
4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but
conversely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported
in 3.3.x.  Our <htmlurl name="Driver Status document" url="Status.html">
summarizes how the hardware driver support compares between &legacyvers;
and &relvers;.  

X11R&relvers; comes with a graphical configuration tool called 
"<tt>xorgcfg</tt>",
which also has a text mode interface and can be used to create an initial
configuration file. It can also be used to customise existing
configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the Xorg
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:
<tscreen><verb>
Xorg -configure
</verb></tscreen>
and follow the instructions.

Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool
"<tt>xorgconfig</tt>" can also be used for generating X server config
files.

At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will
give you a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration
file.  With the automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't
need one!  

If you do need to customise the configuration file, see the <htmlurl
name="xorg.conf manual page" url="xorg.conf.5.html">.  You can also
check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
(found at <ref id="drivertables" name="tables below"> also.

Before downloading  the binary distributions for this release, please
have a quick read through the <htmlurl name="Installation Document"
url="Install.html">.  It may save you some time and also help you figure out
which of the binary releases you need.

don't have enough space to cover them all here.

the X source tree.
<sect1>Enhancements in X11R&relvers; beyond XFree86 4.4RC2
<p>
<itemize>


<item> Only files without the new XFree86 1.1 license are included in the
       X11R&relvers; release. Additionally, X.org will be attempting,
       when possible, to contact copyright holders of 
       material in the distribution when those
       copyrights do not follow the Debian Free Software guidelines
       to see if they can be relicensed to adhere to those standards.

<item> Trademark law requires that there be no ambiguity about
       the use of a trademark,
       so the documentation, error message, name of the X executable,
       configuration file name, etc., have all been changed to
       avoid confusion of X.org's implementation with the XFree86&trade; 
       trademarked implementation. Some of the changes made include:
       <itemize>
          <item> The name of the X server is Xorg, rather than XFree86.
          <item> The name of the X server configuration file is 
              /etc/X11/xorg.conf rather than /etc/X11/XF86Config.
              If xorg.conf does not exist, the server will look
              for the old name.
          <item>The config file and servername in xorg.cf is build
                time configurable.
          <item>The vendor string was updated to "X.Org Foundation".
          <item>The X server's log file name was changed to
                Xorg.?.log.
          <item>xf86cfg was renamed xorgcfg.
          <item>xf86config was renamed xorgconfig.
          <item>All messages emitted by the server in the log were
                updated to reflect the change in name.
          <item>The module loader was modified to accept either
                XFree86 generated modules or X.org generated modules.
          <item>Manual pages and other documentation was updated.
       </itemize>

<item> Projective affine transforms and
       the trapezoid primitives were implemented in XFree86 4.3
       with suboptimal performance.  Work is underway to accelerate
       these primitives. The render extension and render library in 
       XFree86 4.4 are stale and
       were updated to version 0.8.4 in X11R&relvers; to fix a number of bugs, by a backport
       from the modular X window system tree.  
       The bugs fixed include checks for
       X servers not implementing render properly (e.g. Solaris
       X servers which advertized support for render but failed
       to support 1, 4, 8, 24, 32 depth pixmaps.) and eliminating
       an unneeded dependence on libXext.
       

<item> Fontconfig will no longer be installed by default since that
       has often/usually resulted in overwriting more recent versions.
       The fontconfig version 2.2.2 shipped in X11R&relvers;
       needs to be build to allow programs in the tree to build that
       depend on it, but those programs will run fine using installed
       versions of fontconfig. If you do want to install the version
       shipped in X11R&relvers; add:
       <tscreen><verb>       
         #define InstallFontconfigLibrary YES
       </verb></tscreen>
       to your host.def. We recommend instead if you need
       to install a current fontconfig version, to get the current version
       from <url name="fontconfig.org" url="http://www.fontconfig.org">.

<item> Freetype was updated to version 2.1.7. 
       But installing freetype from X distributions would often or
       usually result in the replacement or use of "stale" versions 
       of freetype. On Linux, FreeBSD, and SCO5, therefore, X11R&relvers;
       will by default use the version of freetype2 that is installed
       on the system. If your system doesn't come with an installed
       freetype2 and you wish to use the version supplied with this
       distribution, please add:
       <tscreen><verb>       
           #define HasFreetype2 NO
       </verb></tscreen>
       to config/cf/host.def. Additonally, the default font
       renderer for Truetype that is loaded by the X server was changed
       to freetype.

<item> During the build, the version of expat that is
       installed on the system is used by default on Microsoft
       Windows, FreeBSD, Linux and SCO5.
       If your system doesn't come with an installed expat and you whish to 
       use the version supplied with this tree please add:
       <tscreen><verb>       
       #define HasExpat NO 
       </verb></tscreen>
       to config/cf/host.def. <url name="Libexpat's" 
            url="http://www.libexpat.org"> web site has current versions.

<item>  During build the version of zlib that is installed on the system
        is used by default on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS (Darwin), 
        Microsoft Windows (Cygwin), Linux, SUN Solaris, and SCO5. 
	If your system doesn't come with an installed zlib and you wish to 
        use the version supplied with this tree please add:
        <tscreen><verb>
        #define HasZlib NO 
       </verb></tscreen>
        to config/cf/host.def.
        <url name="Zlib's" url="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/"> web site
        has current versions of zlib.

<item> You are likely to need the ncurses and libpng libraries including
       the development header files. Builds will also require
       groff, flex, and optionally, perl5.

<item> The TinyX (kdrive) driver was removed entirely from the tree
       in X11R&relvers;. The version in XFree86 4.4 was 15 
       months out of date as of XFree86 4.4's release in February 2004, 
       and is not supported in the monolithic Xorg X server tree. 
       Please turn to
       <url name="freedesktop.org's X Server project" 
        url="http://xserver.freedesktop.org"> for
       current kdrive support, including the new composite,
       damage, and X fixes extension under development.

<item> Xft was updated to version 2.1.5, to fix bugs with Freetype
       compatibility.

<item> The remains of XIE and PEX extensions were removed completely.
       Similarly, libxml2's remains were removed, as it is not used
       at all in the distribution.

<item> The new fontstoft utility to convert .bdf/.pcf fonts to .ttf
       format was removed as it is not yet ready and working.
       Please turn to
       <url name="freedesktop.org's X Applications"
        url="http://xapps.freedesktop.org"> for a newer version.

<item> Allow left and right modifier keys to be distinguished on Mac OS X 
       10.3. (Does not work on earlier versions.)

 </itemize>

<sect1>Summary of new features in Cygwin/X
<p>
This is a sampling of the new features in Cygwin/X in X11R&fullrelvers;.
<sect2>Cygwin/X Notes
<p>
Cygwin/X has continued its rapid pace of development that it has
sustained since Spring 2001 and this release shows it, we now have: a
stable and fast multi-window mode, seamless clipboard integration, a
configurable tray menu icon, popups on error messages pointing users
to the log file and our mailing list, the beginnings of indirect 3D
acceleration for OpenGL applications, improved non-US keyboard and
clipboard support, and only a handful of bugs that continue to be
reported.
<p>
Between the XFree86 4.3.0 release and the X.Org X116.7 release the
Cygwin/XFree86 project broke away from The XFree86 Project, Inc. due
to a lack of support from the XFree86 project.  As such, the Cygwin/XFree86
project was renamed to the Cygwin/X project and the upstream source
code tree that Cygwin/X pulls from and pushes to is now the tree
managed by the X.Org Foundation.  The Cygwin/X project has seen a rush
of development and interest in the project since the split; one metric
showing this is that the number of CVS committers we have has gone
from zero to six.
<sect2>Cygwin/X-specific Changes
<p>
[Note: This list is by no means complete and covers issues that were
either specific to the Cygwin/X DDX or were reported as problems by a
number of Cygwin/X users, thus creating an interest in such a problem
being fixed.  The complete <url name="Cygwin/X-specific change logs"
 url="http://x.cygwin.com/devel/server/changelog-full.html"> can be seen

<item> Merged in work on the NativeGDI engine.  (Alan Hourihane)
</itemize>
<sect1>Video Driver Enhancements

<p>
<itemize>
<item>Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M,
	845G, 852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been
	fixed.  Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video
	BIOS remain, especially for some laptops.

<item>The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700,
		which didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

	<item>The driver now does a much better job of auto-detecting
		which connector of dual output cards the monitor is
		attached to, and this should reduce or eliminate the
		need for manual xorg.conf overrides.

	<item>The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce has been completely
		rewritten and its performance should be substantially
		improved.

	<item>TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which
		does scaled YUV bit blits.

	</itemize>

<item>The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:

	<itemize>
	<item>Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).

	<item>Merged Framebuffer mode.

	<item>Support for DVI, and much more.

	<item>DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported
		again.

	</itemize>

<item>A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been added.

<item>Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.

</itemize>

<sect1>Input Driver Enhancements

<p>
<itemize>
<item>The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for
	auto-detecting which device node to use. This makes it unnecessary
	to supply this information in the xorg.conf file in most cases.

</itemize>

<sect1>IPv6 support
<p>
X11R&relvers; supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun
Microsystems, Inc. to X.Org. See <url name="X.org's document"
url="http://www.x.org/IPV6_Specific_Changes.html"> for a detailed list
of what these changes are and how your system is affected by them.

<sect2>Protocol names and aliases. 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.
<item>inet specifies IPv4 only. 
<item>inet6 specifies IPv6 only.
</itemize>
<p>
You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the
<tt>X -nolisten inet6 </tt> command or you can force a IPv6 connection
by setting <bf>DISPLAY</bf> to <tt>inet6/host:0</tt>.

<sect2>XDM
<p>
The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't 
support binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address. 
<p>
The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentication scheme does not support IPv6
addresses but a new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has
been designed; this though is yet to be  implemented.  By default 
builds do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.


<sect1>X Server and Extension Updates

<p>
<itemize>

<item>The Mesa version used for OpenGL&reg; 1.3 and DRI driver support
	has been updated to 5.0.2.

</itemize>

<sect1>Client and Library Updates

<p>
<sect2>Xterm
<p>

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

	Bug Fixes:
	<itemize>
	<item>Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu
		entries that would send signals to, or exit xterm.

	<item>Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally
		implemented.

	<item>Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use
		shifted pageup, wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse
		pointer is over the scrollbar.

	<item>Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.

	</itemize>

	New Features:
	<itemize>
	<item>Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile
		name to append the process-id rather than a random value.

	<item>Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an
		adjustment value, e.g.,
		<tscreen><verb>
scroll-back(1, page-2)
		</verb></tscreen>
		to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.
		
	<item>Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of
		time used for visual bell, for very slow displays or
		very fast computers.

	</itemize>

	Improved Locale Support:
	<itemize>
	<item>modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@euro" from the
		locale setting before adding ".UTF-8".

	<item>Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to
		load fonts specified by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.
		The subresources have the same names as the fonts which
		they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so that the
		ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm
		app-defaults file.

	<item>Improved performance with chinput application.

	</itemize>

	Improved Font Handling:
	<itemize>
	<item>Document in xterm's manual page how to use XFree86 ":unscaled"
		keyword to suppress scaling of bold fonts.

	<item>Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal
		fontname.

	<item>Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

	<item>Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

	<item>Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):
		<itemize>
		<item>Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

		<item>Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to
			xterm) for line-drawing to xterm's internal
			code, etc., since TrueType fonts generally do
			not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.
			xterm can draw these directly.

		<item>Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to
			xtermXftDrawString() to allow for wide-characters.

		<item>Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

		<item>Implement underlining.
		</itemize>

	<item>Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

	<item>Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace)
		fonts.

	</itemize>

	Workarounds for Special Applications:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow
		users of non-VTxxx character sets such as KOI-8 to treat
		the C1 control area (character codes 128-159) as printable
		rather than control characters.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource
		brokenStringTerm to allow user to revert one part of
		the parsing table corrections.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource
		brokenLinuxOSC to accommodate scripts which do not
		distinguish between running in the Linux console and
		running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed control
		strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length,
		with no terminator.

	<item>Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow
		one to compile-in support for the pty handshaking logic,
		and resource ptyHandshake to enable or disable it.  This
		feature is normally enabled.

	</itemize>

	Modified Resources:
	<itemize>
	<item>Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides
		better contrast.

	<item>Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only
		in XTerm-col.ad

	<item>Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color"
		rather than "XTerm", in case the latter file contains
		no color resource definitions.

	<item>Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since
		ColorMode is associated with boolean resources.

	<item>Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources
		that override colors when a video attribute is set to
		ColorAttrMode, to make them distinct from ColorMode.
		This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse video,
		for example.

	</itemize>

	Modified terminfo/termcap entries:
	<itemize>
	<item>Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

	<item>Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing
		from older termcaps for xterm, some applications check
		for it.

	<item>Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and
		xterm-88color entries.

	</itemize>

<sect1>I18N and Font Updates

<p>
<itemize>

<item>The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the
	<url name="After X-TT Project" url="http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/"> to
	include the functionality previously provided by the "xtt" backend,
	and to fix some bugs.  The "xtt" backend will be dropped in the
	next release in favour of the updated unified "freetype" backend.

	<itemize>
	<item>The new "freetype" backend has the improved "very lazy" metric
		calculation method which enables super-fast loading of
		proportional CJKV fonts.

	<item>All of the servers, including xfs, Xnest, Xprt, Xvfb, the
		Cygwin-X server (as well as the Xorg server)
		can handle the perfect TTCap options.

	</itemize>

<item>The Compose file processing mechanism has been improved and made
	more flexible.  See the <ref id="compose" name="Xlib Compose
	file support and extensions section below">.

<item>The Bitstream Vera TrueType fonts that Bitstream, Inc donated to
	the GNOME Foundation have been included with this release.

</itemize>

<sect1>OS Support Updates

<p>
<itemize>
<item>On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
	loaded at runtime which reduces the X server's memory footprint.
	In rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.
	(Xplugin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin,
	XDarwin provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including
	the following improvements over 4.3:
	<itemize>
	<item>Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.
	<item>Faster 2-D drawing.
	<item>Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
		with quartz-wm.
	</itemize>

<item>On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

<item>Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

<item>Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

<item>SCO OpenServer support updates.  X11R6.7 now works on Release
5.0.7 with Maintenance Pack 1, or on prior releases through Release
5.0.4.  Please consult the <htmlurl name="README.SCO" url="SCO.html">
file for details.

<sect>Known Problems
<p>

<itemize>
<item>Known issues with this version of the SiS driver:

	<itemize>
	<item>The driver will not work with upcoming laptops/notebooks
	with 661/741/760 and 30xLV bridges as regards LCD output. This
	is due folks at SiS at the very moment writing an entirely new
	VBIOS for such machines whose data layout is not decided yet.
	(This might affect machines with 650/740 as well within the next
	year.)

	<item>Xv does not work correctly in TV NTSC 1024x768 mode, if
	the overlay is very large (or full screen). The effect are
	flickering lines on the screen. This is a hardware problem. Do
	not use this mode for video.

	<item>YPbPr 720p output is blurry (at least at 1024x768; unknown
	for other modes). This is a driver problem; solution currently
	unknown.

	</itemize>

<item>We have received a late report that enabling DPMS support with
the radeon driver can damage some Viewsonic monitors.  DPMS is usually
disabled by default.  You can verify whether or not DPMS is enabled by
running 'xset q' from within your X session.

</itemize>

<sect>Overview of X11R6.7.x
<p>
X11R6.7.x has a single X server binary called <tt>Xorg</tt>.  This
binary can either have one or more video and input drivers linked in
statically, or more usually, dynamically, and in that manner load the
video drivers, input drivers, and other modules that are needed.

X11R&relvers; has X server support for most UNIX&reg; and UNIX-like
operating systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and
some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms,
and for Darwin on PowerPC.  Support for additional architectures
and operating systems is in progress and is planned for future releases.

<sect1>Loader and Modules
<p>
The X server has a built-in run-time loader, which can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
The loader does not rely on an operating system's native dynamic
loader support and it works on platforms that do not provide this feature.
This  allows  for the modules to be operating system independent (although
not, of course, CPU architecture independent) which means that a module
compiled on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86,
or FreeBSD, or even OS/2.

A main benefit of this, is that when modules are updated, they do not
need to be recompiled for every different operating system.  The loader
in version &relvers; has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and PowerPC
platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb,
cfb, etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject
to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward
compatibility for the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning
that 4.0 modules will work with future core X server binaries), we cannot
guarantee this.  Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly
not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces added in new
releases.

<bf>Note about module security</bf>
<quote><p>
	The X server runs with root privileges, i.e. 
	the X server loadable modules also run with these privileges.
	For this reason we recommend that all users be careful to only
	use loadable modules from reliable sources,  otherwise the
	introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and
	wreak havoc on your system.  We hope to have a mechanism for
	signing/verifying the modules that we provide available in a
	future release.

</quote>

<sect1>Configuration File <label id="config">
<p>

The X server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <htmlurl name="xorg.conf(5)"
url="xorg.conf.5.html"> manual page.

The X server has support for automatically determining an initial
configuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic
initial configuration file.

<sect1>Command Line Options
<p>

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <htmlurl name="Xorg(1)"
url="Xorg.1.html"> manual page.
  
<sect1>XAA
<p>

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten
from scratch for XFree86 4.x and is used in X11R&relvers;.  
Most drivers implement acceleration by
making use of the XAA module.
The Xorg server will accept modules built either for XFree86 4.4
servers or its own.

<sect1>Multi-head
<p>
Some multi-head configurations are supported in XFree86 4.x and
X11R6.x, primarily with multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising
cards that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved
somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which
allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are
other issues that still need to be resolved.  Some combinations can be
made to work better by changing which card is the primary card (either
by using a different PCI slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference
for the primary card).

<sect1>Xinerama
<p>
Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens
to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
<tt>+xinerama</tt> command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in X11R6.7.x
and XFree86 4.x
was completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.

Known problems:
<itemize>
  <item>Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some
	operations like window placement and resizing might not behave
	in an ideal way.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with
	in the individual window managers, and isn't specifically an
	X server problem.

</itemize>

<sect1>DGA version 2
<p>

DGA 2.0 is included in &relvers;.
Documentation for the client libraries can be found in the <htmlurl
name="XDGA(3)" url="XDGA.3.man"> man page.  A good degree of backwards
compatibility with version 1.0 is provided.


<sect1>DDC
<p>
The VESA&reg; Display Data Channel (DDC&trade;) standard allows the monitor
to tell the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about
itself; particularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section
entry:  <tt>Option "NoDDC"</tt>.  We have support for DDC versions 1
and 2; these can be disabled independently with <tt>Option "NoDDC1"</tt>
and <tt>Option "NoDDC2"</tt>.

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and
can use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to
warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file
don't match those that are detected.

<sect2>Changed behavior caused by DDC.
<p>
Several drivers uses DDC information to
set the screen size and pitch.  This can be overridden by explicitly
resetting it to the and non-DDC default value 75 with the <tt>-dpi
75</tt> command line option for the X server, or by specifying appropriate
screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor" section
of the config file.


<sect1>GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
<p>

Direct rendered OpenGL&reg; support is provided for several hardware
platforms by the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information
about DRI can be found at the <url name="DRI Project's web site"
url="http://dri.sf.net/">.  The 3D core rendering component is provided by
<url name="Mesa" url="http://www.mesa3d.org">.

<sect1>XVideo Extension (Xv)
<p>

The XVideo extension is supported in X11R6.7.x.
An XvQueryPortAttributes function has been added as well as
support for XvImages.  XvImages are XImages in alternate color spaces 
such as YUV and can be passed to the server through shared memory
segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with high quality
hardware scaling and filtering.

<sect1>X Rendering Extension (Render) <label id="render">
<p>

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more
closely matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides
a rendering model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image
composition rather than binary raster operations.

<p>
Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render
can draw anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform 
translucent image overlays and other image operations not possible with 
the core X rendering system.

<p>
Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for
Render applications.

<sect2>The Xft Library
<p>

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for
applications using the FreeType library, version 2.  One 
important thing to note is that Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor 
to compute accurate pixel sizes for provided point sizes; if your monitor 
doesn't provide accurate information via DDC, you may want to add that 
information to <tt>xorg.conf</tt>.

<p>

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text
rendering to the Render extension, Xft can use either the core rendering
requests or the Render extension for text.  
See the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on
configuring X11R&relvers; to use an existing FreeType installation.

<p>
The Xft library uses configuration files, <tt>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</tt>
and <tt>/etc/fonts/local.conf</tt>, which
contains information about which directories contain font files and also
provides a sophisticated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that
file is included in the <htmlurl name="Xft(3)" url="Xft.3.man"> man page.

</sect2>

<sect2>Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text
<p>

Only three applications have been modified in X11R&relvers; to work 
with the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide 
anti-aliased text.  Xterm, xditview and x11perf.  Migration of other 
applications may occur in future releases.

<p>
By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has
a command line option and associated resource to direct it to use
Xft instead:
<itemize>
  <item><tt>-fa</tt> family / <tt>.VT100.faceName:</tt> family.  Selects the 
	font family to use.
</itemize>

<p>
Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf 
includes tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, 
anti-aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky 
text, but through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat
slower than core text.
</sect2>

<sect1>Other extensions
<p>

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server
architecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported
to the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further
work, and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has
support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this
is possible.  The <tt>xgamma</tt> utility makes use of this feature.
Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the extension is provided.
The missing parts of this extension and some new features should be
completed in a future release.

<sect1>xedit
<p>

Xedit has several new features, including:
<itemize>
  <item>An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.
  <item>Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and Lisp.
  <item>Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.

<!--
<sect>Fonts and Internationalisation
<p>
-->

<sect1>Font support
<p>

Details about the font support in X11R&relvers;.x can be found
in the <htmlurl name="README.fonts" url="fonts.html"> document.

<sect1>TrueType support
<p>

X11R6.7.x and XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as
"FreeType" backend (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and `X-TrueType'
(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module).  Both of these backends are based on the
FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType has been merged into
the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for XFree86 4.4.
Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped 
in the next major release.

<sect1>CID font support
<p>

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in X11R&relvers;.x.
The CID-keyed font format was designed by <url name="Adobe Systems"
url="http://www.adobe.com"> for fonts with large character sets.  The
CID-keyed font support in X11R&relvers; was donated by <url name="SGI"
url="http://www.sgi.com">.  See the <htmlurl name="LICENSE"
url="LICENSE.html"> document for a copy of the CID Font Code Public
License.

<sect1>Internationalisation of the scalable font backends
<p>

X11R6.7.x has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the scalable font backends
to use a common method of font re-encoding.  This re-encoding makes it
possible to uses fonts in encodings other than their their native
encoding.  This layer is used by the Type1 and Speedo backends and the
`xfsft' version of the TrueType backend.  The `X-TrueType' version of
the TrueType backend uses a different re-encoding method based on loadable
encoding modules.

<sect1>Large font optimisation
<p>

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font
have access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant
memory consumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is
transmitted in a compressed format.

<sect1>Unicode/ISO 10646 support
<p>
What is included in X11R6.7.x

<itemize>
  <item>All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the
        ISO10646-1 encoding and cover at least the 614 characters
        found in ISO 8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The
        non-bold fonts also cover all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)
        characters, including those found in all 8-bit MS-DOS/Windows
        code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF
        fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
        automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

  <item>Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a
        comprehensive Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters
        including all Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian,
        Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus numerous scientific,
	typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
        symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian,
        Thai, Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13
        font there is now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18
        font there is a 18x18ja Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which
        covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554) characters. The 9x18 font
        can also be used to implement simple combining characters by
        accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus Kuhn's
        <url name="UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ"
        url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">.

  <item>Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer
	Modern).

  <item>ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm
	(enabled with the <tt>-u8</tt> option).

  <item>Both the xfsft (the <tt>"freetype"</tt> module) and the X-TrueType
	(the <tt>"xtt"</tt> module) TrueType font backends support
	Unicode-encoded fonts.

</itemize>

<sect1>Xlib Compose file support and extensions <label id="compose">
<p>

A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
X11R6.7.0.  The compose file is searched for in 
the following order:

<enum>
<item>If the environment variable <bf>$XCOMPOSEFILE</bf> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

<item>If the user's home directory has a file named "<tt>.XCompose</tt>", it
is used as the Compose file.

<item>The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>".

</enum>

Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:
<tscreen><verb>
include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
</verb></tscreen>
There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <bf>%H</bf> expands to the user's home directory
(the <bf>$HOME</bf> environment variable), and <bf>%L</bf> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<it>xlocaledir</it>&gt;<tt>/</tt>&lt;<it>localename</it>&gt;<tt>/Compose</tt>").

For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:
<tscreen><verb>
include "%L"
</verb></tscreen>
and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.

Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:
<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : "\300" Agrave
</verb></tscreen>
the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:
<tscreen><verb>
<dead_grave> <A> : Agrave
</verb></tscreen>
the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

<sect1>Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes <label id="luxi">
<p>

The X distribution includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type&nbsp;1 fonts and 
TrueType
fonts.  This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi&nbsp;Serif'',
``Luxi&nbsp;Sans'' and ``Luxi&nbsp;Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and
bold oblique variants.  The TrueType version have glyphs covering the
basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin&nbsp;1 range, as well as the
<it/Extended Latin/ range and some additional punctuation characters.
In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for ISO&nbsp;8859
parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the Adobe
Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type&nbsp;1 versions is somewhat reduced,
and only covers ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe
Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow
from Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs
in Ikarus digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted
the Ikarus format fonts to TrueType and Type&nbsp;1 font programs and
implemented the grid-fitting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi
fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file
`<tt/COPYRIGHT.BH/', as well as in the <htmlurl
name="License document" url="LICENSE.html">.  For further information,
please contact
<email>design@bigelowandholmes.com</email> or
<email>info@urwpp.de</email>, or consult the
