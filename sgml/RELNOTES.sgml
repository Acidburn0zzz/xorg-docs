<para>
The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.
X11 refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window
system is based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been
stable for 21 years, with only upward compatible additions to the core X
protocol, a record of stability envied in computing.  Formal releases of
X started with X version 9 from MIT; the first commercial X products
were based on X version 10.  The MIT X Consortium and its successors,
the X Consortium, the Open Group X Project Team, and the X.Org Group
released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6.  Since the founding of the
X.Org Foundation in early 2004, many further releases have been
issued, from X11R6.7 to the current &relvers;.

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    <firstterm>Multi-Pointer X (<acronym>MPX</acronym>)</firstterm>
	    provides the user with multiple independent mouse cursors and
	    multiple independent keyboard foci.  Each cursor is a true system
	    cursor and different pointers can operate in multiple applications
	    simultaneously.
	  </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    <firstterm>Input device properties</firstterm> allow you to attach
	    properties to a device. These properties can be of arbitrary type
	    and can be changed without the server having to know their details.
	  </para>
        </listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <firstterm>X Input Extension version 2.0
		(<acronym>XI2</acronym>)</firstterm> is designed to
	    replace both core input processing and prior
	    versions of the X Input Extension.   Besides MPX, it provides a
	    number of other enhancements over version 1.5, including:
	    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

	      <listitem><para>use of XGE and GenericEvents.</para></listitem>
	      <listitem><para>explicit device hierarchy of master and slave devices.</para></listitem>

        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    <firstterm>Resize, Rotate and Reflect Extension
	      (<acronym>RANDR</acronym>) version 1.3</firstterm>
	    builds on the changes made with version 1.2 and adds some new
	    capabilities without fundmentally changing the extension again.
	    The following features are added in this version:
	    <variablelist>
	      <varlistentry>
		<term>Projective Transforms</term>
		<listitem><para>
		    The implementation work for general rotation support made
		    it trivial to add full projective transformations. These
		    can be used to scale the screen up/down as well as perform
		    projector keystone correct or other effects.
		</para></listitem>
	      </varlistentry>
	      <varlistentry>
		<term>Panning</term>
		<listitem><para>
		    Panning was removed with RandR 1.2 because the old
		    semantics didn't fit any longer. With RandR 1.3 panning
		    can be specified per crtc.
		  </para></listitem>
	      </varlistentry>
	    </variablelist>
	  </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <firstterm><acronym>DRI2</acronym> extension</firstterm>
	    is designed to associate and access auxillary rendering
	    buffers with an X drawable.  It is a essentially a helper
	    extension to support implementation of direct rendering
	    drivers/libraries/technologies.
	    The main consumer of this extension will be a direct
	    rendering OpenGL driver, but the DRI2 extension is not
	    designed to be OpenGL specific.  Direct rendering
	    implementations of OpenVG, Xv, cairo and other graphics
	    APIs should find the functionality exposed by this
	    extension helpful and hopefully sufficient.
	  </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
	  <para>
	    <firstterm>Video and input driver enhancements</firstterm>.
	    Please see the ChangeLog files for individual drivers; there are
	    far too many updates to list here.
	  </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
	  <para>
            ... and the usual assortment of correctness and crash fixes.

<title>Overview of X11R&relvers;</title>

    <para>
      On most platforms, X11R&relvers; has a single hardware-driving
      X server binary called <command>Xorg</command>.  This binary can
      dynamically load the video drivers, input drivers, and other modules
      that are needed.

      <command>Xorg</command> has currently has support for Linux, Solaris,
      and some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Intel x86, Sparc,
      and MIPS platforms.

    </para>

    <para>
      Additional specialized X server binaries may be found depending on
      the platform and build configuration, including:

      <glosslist>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm><command>Xdmx</command></glossterm>
	  <glossdef><para>
	    is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
	    display devices.  It provides multi-head X functionality for
	    displays that might be located on different machines.
	  </para></glossdef>
	</glossentry>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm><command>Xnest</command></glossterm>
	  <glossdef><para>
	    is a nested X server, that operates as both an X client and X
	    server.  <command>Xnest</command> is a client of the real server
	    which manages windows and graphics requests on its behalf.
	    <command>Xnest</command> is a server to its own clients, and
	    manages windows and graphics requests on their behalf.
	    To these clients, it appears to be a conventional server.
	  </para></glossdef>
	</glossentry>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm><command>Xephyr</command></glossterm>
	  <glossdef><para>
	    is a X server that outputs to a window on a pre-existing "host"
	    X display.  Unlike <command>Xnest</command> which is an X proxy,
	    and thus limited to the capabilities of the host X server,
	    <command>Xephyr</command> is a full X server which uses the host
	    X server window as "framebuffer" via fast SHM XImages.
	  </para></glossdef>
	</glossentry>
	<glossentry>
	  <glossterm><command>Xvfb</command></glossterm>
	  <glossdef><para>
	    is a virtual framebuffer X server that can run on machines with

        <title>Loader and Modules</title>

        <para>
        The Xorg server
        relies on the operating system's native module loader support for
        handling program modules. The X server makes use of modules for
        video drivers, X server extensions, font rasterisers, input device
        drivers, framebuffer layers, and internal components used by some
        drivers (like XAA).
        </para>

        <para>
        The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are
        subject to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide
        backward compatibility for the module interfaces, we cannot
        guarantee this. Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly
        not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces added in
        new releases.
        </para>

        <warning>
        <title>Note about module security</title>
        <para>The X server runs with root privileges, i.e.,
        the X server loadable modules also run with these privileges.
        For this reason we recommend that all users be careful to only
        use loadable modules from reliable sources,  otherwise the
        introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and
        wreak havoc on your system.  We hope to have a mechanism for
        signing/verifying the modules that we provide available in a
        future release.
        </para></warning>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="config">
        <title>Configuration File</title>

        <para>
        The X server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
        for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
        file format is described in detail in the <ulink URL="xorg.conf.5.html">
        xorg.conf(5)</ulink> manual page.
        </para>

        <para>
        Note that this release features significant improvements
        for running the server without a configuration file, so many users
        may find that that they don't need a configuration file.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you do need to customize the configuration file, see the <ulink
        URL="xorg.conf.5.html"
        >xorg.conf manual page</ulink> .  You can also
        check the driver-specific manual pages and the related
        documentation (found at <xref LinkEnd="drivertables"> also.
        </para>

        <para>
        The recommended method for generating a configuration file is to use
        the Xorg server itself.  Run as root:

        <screen>
        Xorg -configure
        </screen>
         and follow the instructions.
        </para>

    </sect2>

    <Sect2>
        <title>Command Line Options</title>

        <para>
        Command line options can be used to override some default
        parameters and parameters provided in the configuration file.
        These command line options are described in the <ulink
        URL="Xorg.1.html">Xorg(1)</ulink> manual page.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
        <title>XAA</title>

        <para>
        The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten
        from scratch for XFree86 4.x and is used in X11R&relvers;.
        Most drivers implement acceleration by making use of the XAA module.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
        <title>EXA</title>

        <para>
        EXA was created as a new driver acceleration architecture to
        replace XAA. EXA was designed specifically to accelerate Render
        operations. This release features improved driver support for EXA.
        See the individual driver changelogs for details. Users should
        beware that EXA support is considered to be incomplete in
        X11R&relvers;.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
        <title>Multi-head</title>

        <para>
        Some multi-head configurations are supported in X11R&relvers;, primarily
        with multiple PCI/AGP cards.
        </para>

        <para>
        One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently
        initializing cards that were not initialized at boot time.  This
        has been improved somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by
        most drivers (which allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but
        in some cases there are other issues that still need to be
        resolved.  Some combinations can be made to work better by changing
        which card is the primary card (either by using a different PCI
        slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference for the primary
        card).
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
        <title>Xinerama</title>
        <para>
        Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens
        to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
        windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
        limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
        all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
        an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.
        </para>

        <para>
        Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
        <option>+xinerama</option> command line option for the
        X server.
        </para>

        <para>
        Known problems:

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some
                operations like window placement and resizing might not behave
                in an ideal way.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with
                in the individual window managers, and isn't specifically an
                X server problem.

        URL="XDGA.3.man">XDGA(3)</ulink> man page.  A good degree of
        backward compatibility with version 1.0 is provided.  DGA should be

    <sect2>
        <title>DDC</title>

        <para>
        The VESA&reg; Display Data Channel (DDC&trade;) standard allows the
        monitor to tell the video card (or on some cases the computer
        directly) about itself; particularly the supported screen
        resolutions and refresh rates.
        </para>

        <para>
        Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video
        drivers.  DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a
        "Device" section entry:  <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC"</literal>.  We have support for DDC versions 1 and 2; these
        can be disabled independently with <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC1"</Literal> and <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC2"</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
        At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display,
        and can use this information to set the default monitor parameters,
        or to warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the
        configuration file don't match those that are detected.
        </para>

            <title>Changed behavior caused by DDC.</title>

            <para>
            Several drivers uses DDC information to set the screen size and
            pitch.  This can be overridden by explicitly resetting it to
            the and non-DDC default value 75 with the <option>-dpi 75</option>
	    command line option for the X
            server, or by specifying appropriate screen dimensions with the
            "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor" section of the config
            file.

        <para>
        Direct rendered OpenGL&reg; support is provided for several
        hardware platforms by the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).
        Further information about DRI can be found at the <ulink

        </para>

        <para>
        Of note is that this release supports building the X server using
        the system-wide libdrm. Previously, drm was kept in the server's
        tree and loaded as a module, rather than using the standard OS
        mechanisms for managing shared libraries of code. This requires
        that the server be built using a version of libdrm of 2.3.0 or
        newer if it is to use DRM.

                <Para>
                If the user's home directory has a file named 
	        "<filename>.XCompose</filename>", it is used as the Compose
                file.

                <Para>
                The old method is used, and the compose file is
                "&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">xlocaledir</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal
                remap="tt">/</Literal>&lt;<Emphasis
                remap="it">localename</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal

        <Para>
        Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows
        local modifications to be made to existing compose files without
        including all of the content directly.  For example, the system's
        iso8859-1 compose file can be included with a line like this:

        <Screen>
        include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
        </Screen>
        There are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
        include instruction.  <Emphasis remap="bf">&percnt;H</Emphasis> expands to the user's home directory
        (the <Emphasis remap="bf">$HOME</Emphasis> environment variable), and <Emphasis remap="bf">&percnt;L</Emphasis> expands to the
        name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e.,
        "&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">xlocaledir</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/</Literal>&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">localename</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/Compose</Literal>").
        </Para>

        <Para>
        For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
        by using:

        <Screen>
        include "%L"
        </Screen>
        and then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New
        compose rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of
        a rule a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If
        the string is omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym
        according to the current locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

        <Screen>
        &#60;dead_grave&#62; &#60;A&#62; : "\300" Agrave
        </Screen>
        the result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300"
        code.  But if the rule is:

        <Screen>
        &#60;dead_grave&#62; &#60;A&#62; : Agrave
        </Screen>
        the result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.

        <Title>Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes </Title>

        <Para>
        The X distribution includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type&nbsp;1
        fonts and TrueType fonts.  This family consists of the fonts
        ``Luxi&nbsp;Serif'', ``Luxi&nbsp;Sans'' and ``Luxi&nbsp;Mono'' in
        Roman, oblique, bold and bold oblique variants.  The TrueType
        version have glyphs covering the basic ASCII Unicode range, the
        Latin&nbsp;1 range, as well as the <Emphasis remap="it">Extended
        Latin</Emphasis> range and some additional punctuation characters.
        In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for
        ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the
        glyphs in the Adobe Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1
        character set.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        The glyph coverage of the Type&nbsp;1 versions is somewhat reduced,
        and only covers ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe
        Standard encoding.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow
        from Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs
        in Ikarus digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted
        the Ikarus format fonts to TrueType and Type&nbsp;1 font programs and
        implemented the grid-fitting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi
        fonts.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file
        `<Literal remap="tt">COPYRIGHT.BH</Literal>', as well as in the
        <ulink URL="LICENSE.html">License document</ulink>.  For further

    <Title>Miscellaneous</Title>

    <Para>
    This section describes other items of note for the
    X11R&relvers; release.
    </Para>

    <Sect2>
        <Title>Socket directory ownership and permissions</Title>

        <Para>
        The socket directories created in <Literal remap="tt">/tmp</Literal> are now required to be
        owned by root and have their sticky-bit set.  If the permissions are not
        set correctly, the component using this directory will print an error
        message and fail to start.  Common socket directories that are known to
        be affected include:

        <Screen>
        /tmp/.font-unix
        /tmp/.ICE-unix
        /tmp/.X11-unix
        </Screen>

        These directories are used by the font server, 
	<command>xfs</command>,	applications using the Inter-Client
        Exchange protocol (ICE) and the X server, respectively.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        There are several solutions to the problem of when to create these
        directories.  They could be created at install time by the system's
        installer if the <Literal remap="tt">/tmp</Literal> dir is
        persistent.  They could be created at boot time by the system's
        boot scripts (e.g., the <Literal remap="tt">init.d</Literal>
        scripts).  Or, they could be created by PAM modules at service
        startup or user login time.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        The solution chosen is platform dependent, and the system administrator
        should be able to handle creating those directories on any systems that
        do not have the correct ownership or permissions.
        </Para>
    </Sect2>

    <Sect2>
        <Title>Composite exposes extra visuals</Title>

        <Para>
        When the Composite extension is enabled, a new visual is
        created.  This visual is different from the other visuals used by X
        applications in that it includes an alpha component.  It is used by
        the compositing manager and other Composite aware applications.
        </Para>

        <Para>
        Most X applications ignore this visual since it is not useful to
        them; however some applications mistakenly try to use it, which
        will cause them to fail.  An environment variable, 
	<envar>XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS</envar>,
        was added to the X11 library to hide this visual from applications
        that mistakenly try to use it.  If an application fails only when
        the Composite is enabled, try setting this environment variable
        before starting the application.

    <Title>Deprecated components and removal plans</Title>

    <Para>
    This section lists current plans for removal of obsolete or deprecated
    components in the X.Org releases.  As our releases are open source,
    users who continue to require these can find the source in previous
    releases and continue to use these, but the X.Org Foundation and its
    volunteers have decided the burden of continued maintenance and
    distribution in the core X11 releases outweighs the benefits of doing
    so.  In some cases, this is simply because no one has volunteered to do
    continued maintenance, so if software is listed here that you need, you
    can contact <EMAIL>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</EMAIL> to volunteer to
    take over maintainership, either inside or outside of the Xorg release
    process.
