<Abstract>

<Para>
These release notes contains information about features and their status
in the X.Org Foundation X11R&relvers; release.  It is
based on the XFree86 4.4RC2 RELNOTES document published by The
XFree86&trade; Project, Inc.  There are significant updates and
differences in the X.Org release as noted below.
</Para>

<Sect1>
<Title>Introduction to the X11R&relvers; Release</Title>

<Para>
This release is the second modular release of the X Window System.  It
marks the transition to an accelerated development process based on
lightweight releases of individual modules, with integrated roll-up releases
every six months.  This model has worked well for other major open source
projects like Gnome and the Linux kernel, and empowers the user community
by delivering new features and bug fixes as they happen. The next official
release will be X11R&nextrelvers; and is expected in &nextfullreldate;.
</Para>

<Para>
For historical background on the modularization effort see the <ulink
URL="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularizationProposal"
>Modularization Proposal</ulink>.  For help with
how to build and develop in the new modular tree see <ulink
URL="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide"
>Modular Developer's Guide</ulink
>.
</Para>

<Para>
We encourage you to submit bug fixes and enhancements to
freedesktop.org's <ulink
URL="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/"
>bug tracking system</ulink
> using the xorg product, and to
discuss them on <email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.
</Para>

<Para>
The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.
X11 refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window
system is based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been
stable for 18 years, with only upward compatible additions to the core X
protocol, a record of stability envied in computing.  Formal releases of
X started with X version 9 from MIT; the first commercial X products
were based on X version 10.  The MIT X Consortium and its successors,
the X Consortium, the Open Group X Project Team, and the X.Org Group
released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6.  Since the founding of the
X.Org Foundation in early 2004, five further major releases have been
issued, from 6.7 to the current 7.1.

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
EXA enhancements

The new EXA acceleration architecture, introduced in 7.0, has seen many
updates for correctness and performance.  It is still considered a work
in progress; please report bugs in Bugzilla.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
kdrive integration

The kdrive DDX has been integrated.  This provides numerous low-footprint
X servers for embedded systems, as well as several utility servers like
Xephyr (an Xnest-like client) and Xsdl.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Accelerated indirect GLX

Indirect GLX clients can now take advantage of hardware acceleration using
the DRI infrastructure.  This allows for several exciting possibilities,
including accelerated 3D display walls using Xdmx, and high-performance
integration with compositing managers for modern desktop effects.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
New GLX extension: GLX&lowbar;EXT&lowbar;texture&lowbar;from&lowbar;pixmap

This extension allows GLX clients to efficiently bind pixmaps - such as those
provided by the Composite extension for redirected drawing - to OpenGL
textures.  This enables the compositing manager to bring the full force of
OpenGL to bear on the problem of rendering the desktop.

<Title>Updated keyboard mappings</Title>

<Para>
The requirement for XKB data can, in the modular tree, be satisfied either
by the traditional data set (the 'xkbdata' module), or by the dataset from
the xkeyboard-config project (the 'xkbdesc' module).  xkbdesc has numerous
improvements relative to xkbdata: layouts have been cleaned up for
consistency and universal multi-layout support, some new layouts have added,
and some layouts have changed names to be more straightforward and ISO
compliant.  Some setups will need adjustments in order to use xkbdesc.  It
is now strongly encouraged for all distributions to migrate to xkbdesc.

<Title>Overview of X11R&relvers;</Title>

<Para>
On most platforms, X11R&relvers; has a single X server
binary called <Literal remap="tt">Xorg</Literal>.  This binary can either have one or more
video and input drivers linked in statically, or more usually,
dynamically, and in that manner load the video drivers, input drivers,
and other modules that are needed.
</Para>

<Para>
X11R&relvers; has currently has support for Linux, Solaris, and some BSD OSs
on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Intel x86, Sparc, and MIPS platforms and is
expected to have additional platform support in X11R&nextrelvers;.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Loader and Modules</Title>

<Para>
The X server has a built-in run-time loader.  As of X11R7.0, it relies on
the operating system's native module loader support, which enables better
integration with the host operating system (for example: debugger support,
memory protection of the stack and heap, smaller code footprint, etc.).  The
X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions, font
rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers, and internal
components used by some drivers (like XAA),
</Para>

<Para>
The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are subject
to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward
compatibility for the module interfaces, we cannot guarantee this.
Compatibility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because
new modules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.
</Para>

<Para>
<Emphasis remap="bf">Note about module security</Emphasis>
<QUOTE
>The X server runs with root privileges, i.e., 
the X server loadable modules also run with these privileges.
For this reason we recommend that all users be careful to only
use loadable modules from reliable sources,  otherwise the
introduction of viruses and contaminated code can occur and
wreak havoc on your system.  We hope to have a mechanism for
signing/verifying the modules that we provide available in a
future release.</QUOTE
>
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="config">
<Title>Configuration File </Title>

<Para>
The X server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
file format is described in detail in the <ulink
URL="xorg.conf.5.html"
>xorg.conf(5)</ulink
> manual page.
</Para>

<Para>
This release comes with a graphical configuration tool called
"<Literal remap="tt">xorgcfg</Literal>", which also has a text mode interface and can be used
to create an initial configuration file. It can also be used to
customize existing configurations.
</Para>

<Para>
Next in the order of configuration preferences is to use the Xorg
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  Run as root:

<Screen>
Xorg -configure
</Screen>
 and follow the instructions.
</Para>

<Para>
Finally, if all else fails, the trusty old standby text-based tool
"<Literal remap="tt">xorgconfig</Literal>" can also be used for generating X server config
files.
</Para>

<Para>
At least one, and hopefully, all of these configuration options will
give you a reasonable starting point for a suitable configuration
file.  With the automatic mechanism you might even find that you don't
need one!  
</Para>

<Para>
If you do need to customize the configuration file, see the <ulink
URL="xorg.conf.5.html"
>xorg.conf manual page</ulink
>.  You can also
check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documentation
(found at <XRef LinkEnd="drivertables"> also.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Command Line Options</Title>

<Para>
Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the <ulink
URL="Xorg.1.html"
>Xorg(1)</ulink
> manual page.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>XAA</Title>

<Para>
The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten
from scratch for XFree86 4.x and is used in X11R&relvers;.  
Most drivers implement acceleration by making use of the XAA module.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Multi-head</Title>

<Para>
Some multi-head configurations are supported in X11R&relvers;, primarily
with multiple PCI/AGP cards.
</Para>

<Para>
One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initializing
cards that were not initialized at boot time.  This has been improved
somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which
allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are
other issues that still need to be resolved.  Some combinations can be
made to work better by changing which card is the primary card (either
by using a different PCI slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference
for the primary card).
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Xinerama</Title>

<Para>
Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens
to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.
</Para>

<Para>
Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
<Literal remap="tt">+xinerama</Literal> command line option for the X server.
</Para>

<Para>
Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in X11R&relvers;
was completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.
</Para>

<Para>
Known problems:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some
operations like window placement and resizing might not behave
in an ideal way.  This is an issue that needs to be dealt with
in the individual window managers, and isn't specifically an
X server problem.

<Title>DGA version 2</Title>

<Para>
DGA 2.0 is included in &relvers;.
Documentation for the client libraries can be found in the <ulink
URL="XDGA.3.man"
>XDGA(3)</ulink
> man page.  A good degree of backward
compatibility with version 1.0 is provided.  DGA should be considered
deprecated; if you are relying on it, please let us know what you need
it for so we can find better solutions.

<Sect2>
<Title>DDC</Title>

<Para>
The VESA&reg; Display Data Channel (DDC&trade;) standard allows the monitor
to tell the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about
itself; particularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.
</Para>

<Para>
Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section
entry:  <Literal remap="tt">Option "NoDDC"</Literal>.  We have support for DDC versions 1
and 2; these can be disabled independently with <Literal remap="tt">Option "NoDDC1"</Literal>
and <Literal remap="tt">Option "NoDDC2"</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and
can use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to
warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file
don't match those that are detected.
</Para>

<Sect3>
<Title>Changed behavior caused by DDC.</Title>

<Para>
Several drivers uses DDC information to
set the screen size and pitch.  This can be overridden by explicitly
resetting it to the and non-DDC default value 75 with the <Literal remap="tt">-dpi
75</Literal> command line option for the X server, or by specifying appropriate
screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor" section
of the config file.

<Title>GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)</Title>

<Para>
Direct rendered OpenGL&reg; support is provided for several hardware
platforms by the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information
about DRI can be found at the <ulink
URL="http://dri.sf.net/"
>DRI Project's web site</ulink

<Sect2>
<Title>XVideo Extension (Xv)</Title>

<Para>
The XVideo extension is supported in X11R&relvers;.
An XvQueryPortAttributes function has been added as well as
support for XvImages.  XvImages are XImages in alternate color spaces 
such as YUV and can be passed to the server through shared memory
segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with high quality
hardware scaling and filtering.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2 id="render">
<Title>X Rendering Extension (Render) </Title>

<Para>
The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more
closely matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides
a rendering model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image
composition rather than binary raster operations.
</Para>

<Para>
Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render
can draw anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform 
translucent image overlays and other image operations not possible with 
the core X rendering system.
</Para>

<Para>
Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for
Render applications.
</Para>

<Sect3>
<Title>The Xft Library</Title>

<Para>
On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for
applications using the FreeType library, version 2.  One 
important thing to note is that Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor 
to compute accurate pixel sizes for provided point sizes; if your monitor 
doesn't provide accurate information via DDC, you may want to add that 
information to <Literal remap="tt">xorg.conf</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text
rendering to the Render extension, Xft can use either the core rendering
requests or the Render extension for text.  
See the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on
configuring X11R&relvers; to use an existing FreeType
installation.
</Para>

<Para>
The Xft library uses configuration files, <Literal remap="tt">/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</Literal>
and <Literal remap="tt">/etc/fonts/local.conf</Literal>, which
contains information about which directories contain font files and also
provides a sophisticated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that
file is included in the <ulink
URL="Xft.3.man"
>Xft(3)</ulink
> man page.
</Para>

</Sect3>

<Sect3>
<Title>Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text</Title>

<Para>
Only four applications have been modified in X11R&relvers;
to work with the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to
provide anti-aliased text: xterm, xditview, x11perf and xclock.
Migration of other applications may occur in future releases.
</Para>

<Para>
By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has
a command line option and associated resource to direct it to use
Xft instead:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
<Literal remap="tt">-fa</Literal> family / <Literal remap="tt">.VT100.faceName:</Literal> family.  Selects the 
font family to use.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf 
includes tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, 
anti-aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky 
text, but through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat
slower than core text.
</Para>

<Para>
Xclock uses the Render extension to draw the analog face and shares the -fa
option and faceName resources with xterm to select a font for the digital
mode.
</Para>

</Sect3>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Other extensions</Title>

<Para>
The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server
architecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.
</Para>

<Para>
The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported
to the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further
work, and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has
support for changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this
is possible.  The <Literal remap="tt">xgamma</Literal> utility makes use of this feature.
Compatibility with the 3.3.x version of the extension is provided.
The missing parts of this extension and some new features should be
completed in a future release.

<Title>TrueType support</Title>

<Para>
X11R6.7 came with two TrueType backends.  The functionality from the
`X-TrueType' backend has been integrated into the `FreeType' backend which
is designed to transparently support all of the functionality from the
`X-TrueType' backend with the exception of the font encoding libraries; the
`FreeType' backend uses only the fontenc-based encoding system.
</Para>

<Title>CID font support</Title>

<Para>
Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in X11R&relvers;
The CID-keyed font format was designed by <ulink

>Adobe Systems</ulink
> for fonts with large character sets.  The
CID-keyed font support in X11R&relvers; was donated by
<ulink

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Internationalisation of the scalable font backends</Title>

<Para>
X11R&relvers; has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the
scalable font backends to use a common method of font re-encoding.  This
re-encoding makes it possible to uses fonts in encodings other than
their their native encoding.  This layer is used by the Type1 and
FreeType backends.

<Title>Large font optimization</Title>

<Para>
The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font

</Para>

<Para>

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the
ISO10646-1 encoding and cover at least the 614 characters
found in ISO 8859-&lcub;1-5,7-10,14,15&rcub;, CP1252, and MES-1. The
non-bold fonts also cover all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4)
characters, including those found in all 8-bit MS-DOS/Windows
code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF
fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a
comprehensive Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters
including all Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian,
Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus numerous scientific,
typographic, technical, and backward-compatibility
symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian,
Thai, Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13
font there is now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18
font there is a 18x18ja Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which
covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554) characters. The 9x18 font
can also be used to implement simple combining characters by
accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus Kuhn's

<Sect2 id="compose">
<Title>Xlib Compose file support and extensions </Title>

<Para>
A more flexible Compose file processing system was added to Xlib in
X11R&relvers;.  The compose file is searched for in 
the following order:
</Para>

<Para>

<OrderedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
If the environment variable <Emphasis remap="bf">$XCOMPOSEFILE</Emphasis> is set, its value
is used as the name of the Compose file.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
If the user's home directory has a file named "<Literal remap="tt">.XCompose</Literal>", it
is used as the Compose file.

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
The old method is used, and the compose file is
"&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">xlocaledir</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/</Literal>&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">localename</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/Compose</Literal>".

</Para>
</ListItem>

</OrderedList>

</Para>

<Para>
Compose files can now use an "include" instruction.  This allows local
modifications to be made to existing compose files without including all
of the content directly.  For example, the system's iso8859-1 compose file
can be included with a line like this:

<Screen>
include "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/Compose"
</Screen>
There 
are two substitutions that can be made in the file name of the
include instruction.  <Emphasis remap="bf">&percnt;H</Emphasis> expands to the user's home directory
(the <Emphasis remap="bf">$HOME</Emphasis> environment variable), and <Emphasis remap="bf">&percnt;L</Emphasis> expands to the
name of the locale specific Compose file (i.e., 
"&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">xlocaledir</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/</Literal>&lt;<Emphasis remap="it">localename</Emphasis>&gt;<Literal remap="tt">/Compose</Literal>").
</Para>

<Para>
For example, you can include in your compose file the default Compose file
by using:

<Screen>
include "%L"
</Screen>
and 
then rewrite only the few rules that you need to change.  New compose
rules can be added, and previous ones replaced.
</Para>

<Para>
Finally, it is no longer necessary to specify in the right part of a rule
a locale encoded string in addition to the keysym name.  If the string is
omitted, Xlib figures it out from the keysym according to the current
locale.  I.e., if a rule looks like:

<Screen>
&#60;dead_grave&#62; &#60;A&#62; : "\300" Agrave
</Screen>
the 
result of the composition is always the letter with the "\300" code.
But if the rule is:

<Screen>
&#60;dead_grave&#62; &#60;A&#62; : Agrave
</Screen>
the
result depends on how Agrave is mapped in the current locale.
</Para>

<Title>Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes </Title>

<Para>
The X distribution includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type&nbsp;1 fonts and 
TrueType
fonts.  This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi&nbsp;Serif'',
``Luxi&nbsp;Sans'' and ``Luxi&nbsp;Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and
bold oblique variants.  The TrueType version have glyphs covering the
basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin&nbsp;1 range, as well as the
<Emphasis remap="it">Extended Latin</Emphasis> range and some additional punctuation characters.
In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for ISO&nbsp;8859
parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the Adobe
Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.
</Para>

<Para>
The glyph coverage of the Type&nbsp;1 versions is somewhat reduced,
and only covers ISO&nbsp;8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe
Standard encoding.
</Para>

<Para>
The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow
from Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs
in Ikarus digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted
the Ikarus format fonts to TrueType and Type&nbsp;1 font programs and
implemented the grid-fitting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi

<Title>Miscellaneous</Title>

<Para>
This section describes other items of note for the
X11R&relvers; release.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Legacy keyboard driver phase-out</Title>

<Para>
The legacy keyboard driver is no longer compiled into the X server by
default on certain platforms (including Linux).  The newer <Literal remap="tt">kbd</Literal>
driver replaces the older built-in driver.  It is suggested that, if the
X server says that it cannot load the keyboard driver, then the
<Literal remap="tt">xorg.conf</Literal> file should be updated to use the new <Literal remap="tt">kbd</Literal>
driver, which can be done by changing the <Literal remap="tt">Driver</Literal> line in the
<Literal remap="tt">InputDevice</Literal> section.  For example,
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Keyboard0"
        Driver      "kbd"
EndSection
</Screen>

Note that the driver name is case-sensitive.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Socket directory ownership and permissions</Title>

<Para>
The socket directories created in <Literal remap="tt">/tmp</Literal> are now required to be
owned by root and have their sticky-bit set.  If the permissions are not
set correctly, the component using this directory will print an error
message and fail to start.  Common socket directories that are known to
be affected include:

<Screen>
/tmp/.font-unix
/tmp/.ICE-unix
/tmp/.X11-unix
</Screen>

These directories are used by the font server, <Literal remap="tt">xfs</Literal>,
applications using the Inter-Client Exchange protocol (ICE) and the X
server, respectively.
</Para>

<Para>
There are several solutions to the problem of when to create these
directories.  They could be created at install time by the system's
installer if the <Literal remap="tt">/tmp</Literal> dir is persistent.  They could be created
at boot time by the system's boot scripts (e.g., the <Literal remap="tt">init.d</Literal>
scripts).  Or, they could be created by PAM modules at service startup
or user login time.
</Para>

<Para>
The solution chosen is platform dependent, and the system administrator
should be able to handle creating those directories on any systems that
do not have the correct ownership or permissions.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Composite exposes extra visuals</Title>

<Para>
When the Composite extension is enabled via <Literal remap="tt">xorg.conf</Literal> or the
command line, a new visual is created.  This visual is different from
the other visuals used by X applications in that it includes an alpha
component.  It is used by the compositing manager and other Composite
aware applications.
</Para>

<Para>
Most X applications ignore this visual since it is not useful to them;
however some applications mistakenly try to use it, which will cause
them to fail.  An environment variable, <Literal remap="tt">XLIB&lowbar;SKIP&lowbar;ARGB&lowbar;VISUALS</Literal>,
was added to the X11 library to hide this visual from applications that
mistakenly try to use it.  If an application fails only when the
Composite is enabled, try setting this environment variable before
starting the application.
</Para>

<Para>
Since Composite is not enabled by default, it is not expected that this
issue will be visible to most users.

<Title>Deprecated components and removal plans</Title>

<Para>
This section lists current plans for removal of obsolete or deprecated
components in the X.Org releases.  As our releases are open source,
users who continue to require these can find the source in previous
releases and continue to use these, but the X.Org Foundation and its
volunteers have decided the burden of continued maintenance and
distribution in the core X11 releases outweighs the benefits of doing
so.  In some cases, this is simply because no one has volunteered to do
continued maintenance, so if software is listed here that you need, you
can contact <EMAIL
>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</EMAIL
> to volunteer to
take over maintainership, either inside or outside of the Xorg release
process.
