How to install the X.Org Foundation's X Window System release version
X11R&relvers;.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
At this time, the X.org Foundation is not making binary releases; this
will likely change in the not-distant future as our tinderbox system
reaches its full potential.
<p>
However, people are already packaging the distribution
for release in many of the common distributions (e.g. RedHat Fedora,
SuSE Linux, Debian), and you may wish to work with those distributors
on their packaged binaries.
<p>
In the meanwhile, we recommend building X from source and doing 
install on top of your running X installation *after* having carefully
backed up /usr/X11R6 to allow restoration in case of some unanticipated
problems.
See the file INSTALL.TXT in the root of the source distribution for
build and install details.
