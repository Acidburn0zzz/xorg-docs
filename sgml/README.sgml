<abstract>

X11R&relvers; is an Open Source version of the X Window System that supports
many UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris x86) on Intel and other platforms.  This
version is compatible with X11R6.6, 
and is based on the XFree86 4.4.0RC2 code base, which,
in turn was based on the X consortium sample implementation.

<sect>What is X11R&relvers;?
<p>
<![ %updaterel [
X11R&relvers; is the &whichupdaterel; update to X11R&fullrelvers;,
the &whichfullrel; full release in the
<![ %earlyrel; [new]]>
X11R6.7 series.


Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch.  They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are
updating.  They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly
fixes for security issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve
stability.

Pre-release snapshots are provided for beta testing.  You should only install
snapshots if you're comfortable dealing with possibly unstable beta-level
software.  If you find problems with this snapshot, you are encouraged
to report your findings to the public X.org server mailing list:

X11R6.7 is the current X.org Foundation release series, based on the
XFree86 4.x code base.
The first release in
the XFree86 4.x  series was in early 2000.  
The core of X11R6.7 is a modular X server.

Most modern PC video hardware is supported in X11R&relvers;, and
most PC video hardware that isn't supported explicitly can be used with
the "vesa" driver.  The <htmlurl name="Release Notes" url="RELNOTES3.html">
has a table showing the drivers provided with X11R&relvers;, and links
to related documentation.

<![ %updaterel; [
The source for version &relvers; is available as a patch relative to
&prevrelvers;.
The patch file is <tt>&prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz</tt>.

The patch
should be applied to a clean &prevrelvers; source tree, working from
the directory containing the <tt>xc/</tt> directory.  The patch should
be applied by running:

<tscreen><verb>
gzip -d &lt; &prevrelvers;-&relvers;.diff.gz | patch -p0 -E
</verb></tscreen>

Information about getting the source for &prevrelvers can be found in the
README file for that version, which can be found on the

<![ %fullrel [
The source for version &fullrelvers; is split into seven tarballs:

xorg-&fullrelvers;-4.tgz
xorg-&fullrelvers;-5.tgz
xorg-&fullrelvers;-6.tgz
xorg-&fullrelvers;-7.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

The first three contain everything
except the fonts and general X11 documentation.  Those three are sufficient
for building X11R&relvers; if you already have a set of fonts.  The fourth
and fifth contain the fonts.  The sixth contains the source for the
general X11 documentation.  The seventh contains the general X11
documentation in hardcopy format.
