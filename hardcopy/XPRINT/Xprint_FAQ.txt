   The following is a list of questions that are frequently asked about
   Xprint.

   You can help make it an even better-quality FAQ by writing a short
   contribution or update and sending it BY EMAIL ONLY to me. A
   contribution should consist of a question and an answer, and
   increasing number of people sends me contributions of the form "I
   don't know the answer to this, but it must be a FAQ, please answer it
   for me". Please read the FAQ first (including the item "[2]Getting
   Help") and then feel free to ask me if it is not in the FAQ.

   Thanks!

          distributed under ? 

   Q: [145]Why does Xprint not use PPDs for configuration ? 

   Q:

   What is "Xprint" ?
   A:

   In short, "Xprint" is an advanced printing system which enables X11
   applications to use devices like printers, FAX or create documents in
   formats like PostScript, PDF or SVGprint.

   In long, "Xprint" is a very flexible, extensible, scaleable,
   client/server print system based on ISO 10175 (and some other specs)
   and the X11 rendering protocol. Using Xprint an application can
   search, query and use devices like printers, FAX machines or create
   documents in formats like PDF or SVGprint. In particular, an
   application can seek a printer, query supported attributes (like paper
   size, trays, fonts etc.), configure the printer device to match it's
   needs and print on it like on any other X device reusing parts of the
   code which is used for the video card Xserver...
   Q:

   Where can I get Xprint/Xprt from ?
   A:

   Xprint is client-server based, therefore two answers:
     * The server side is available by default on Solaris (see [146]Note
       below) and HP-UX (Xfree86 ships a "Xprt" binary, but that is
       broken and the server config files are missing, too). For those
       platforms who do not have a (working) Xprt server the you can get
       source, binary tarballs and Linux RPMs from
       [147]http://xprint.mozdev.org/, Debian Linux has a package based
       on the same sources (see
       [148]http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xprint-xprintorg.html).

Note
       For Solaris >= 2.7 [149]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ provides the
       "GISWxprintglue" and "GISWxprint" packages (available from
       [150]http://xprint.mozdev.org/download.html) which provides a
       single-step drop-in way to configure and start Xprint at system
       startup and/or per-user for all applications and users (the
       package provides only startup scripts and some config data and
       uses the Xprt binary provided with Solaris
       (/usr/openwin/bin/Xprt)).
     * The client-side Xprint support library (libXp.so) is available on
       all X11 platforms >=R6.4, including Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX,
       FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.
       If you do not have it you can build it from the sources available
       at [151]http://xprint.mozdev.org/.

   Q:

   What is "Xprt" ?
   A:

   Xprt is the server-side of Xprint. It's just like any other Xserver -
   it uses only an other kind of output device (printer instead of
   framebuffer) and implements an extra X11 extension ("XpExtension") to
   handle the special features/requirements of a "paged device"(=printer
   etc.).

   Where can I get help for problems with Xprint ?
   A:

   The current main site for the Xprint development is
   [152]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ which hosts various resources including
   a [153]mailinglist (please subscribe before posting) for end-users,
   admin and developers.
   Q:

   "Why do some people like Xprint ?" / "What are the advantages of
   Xprint ?"
   A:

     * Xprint allows an application to query what features (paper size,
       trays, orientation, resolutions, plexes, fonts and much more) a
       printer supports. For example it is avoidable that a user
       accidently prints DIN-A4 on a DIN-A0 poster printer (the print
       dialog would only offer DIN-A0 as paper size, e.g. offers only
       choices which are valid for this printer).
     * Server-side, localizeable configuration - changes to the server
       config apply to all users without the need to change/updating
       anything on the user side (the user may still start his/her own
       Xprt instance using his/her preferred configuration).
     * Small footprint - ideal for for mobile devices (client side does
       not need to process any fonts - that's the job of the server
       side).
     * API not restriced to PostScript (X11R6.5.1 comes with PCL and
       Raster implementations - and PDF/G3-FAX/SVG would be possible
       without problems).
     * Scaleable - Xprint can use as many Xprt servers as the user/admin
       wants.
     * "Xprint is designed for the enterprise", e.g. Xprint was designed
       to match the needs of large company networks.
     * Automatic font handling - font download or the existence of
       printer-builtin fonts is automagically handled by Xprt - the
       application does not need to know/handle any details (but the
       application can optionally get information and control the usage
       of printer builtin fonts).
     * You can print anything what you can render on the
       framebuffer(=video card) Xserver.
     * Existing code can be reused 1:1 for printing - which means reduced
       development costs.
     * Easy support for I18N (internationalization) - you simply render
       any fonts in any language with Xprint.
     * Network-transparent design - Client can use local or remote Xprt
       servers like any other Xserver.
     * Uses the X11 protocol - easy adoption of existing code to
       implement printer support. And all the network goodies like
       firewall proxies, compressors etc. can be used for Xprint without
       modifications.
     * Security: Xprint can use all authentification schemes available in
       X11 (like Kerberos5, SecureRPC, MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE or host-based
       authentification).
     * Enhachements on the server side (Xprt) to not require the change
       of client-side code.
     * Optimized job output (like the PostScript created by the
       PostScript DDX) is usually a lot smaller than the PS code created
       by other PostScript engines.

   Q:

   Why do some people dislike Xprint ?
   A:

   There are a few common misconceptions about Xprint. Let's take a look
   some of these "myths", some background - and the facts:

   Myth: [154]Xprint prints just a XWD dump of the Xserver bitmap 
   Myth: [155]Xprint cannot handle non-'ISO Latin 1' chars 
   Myth: [156]Xprint uses a 1024x768 screen resolution to render the
          stuff on the paper - therefore it will never be able to do
          high-resolution stuff 

   Myth: [157]Xprint prints only graphics(=bitmap/gfx) fonts 
   Myth: [158]Xprint does not support pages sizes larger than DIN-A4 
   Myth: [159]Xprint does not support rotated text 
   Myth: [160]The X11 rendering model is not good enougth for printers 

   Myth: 

   " Xprint prints just a XWD dump of the Xserver bitmap "
   Fact:

   Whoever says Xprint simply does an "xwd"-like dump is wrong.

   In short, Xprint currently (X11R6.5.1) supports *four* drivers:
    1. X to native Postscript
    2. X to native PCL5
    3. X to native PCL3
    4. X to a raster which is then feed to something like xpr to create
       PS or PCL5 wrapped rasters.

   In long, the original X Print Service ("XPS") was attempted during CDE
   1.0, and they only got so far as the "raster" driver.

   As CDE 2.0 came around, Bob Schiefler and others at the X Consortium
   agreed that the X Consortium would work on a X to native PS Level 2
   driver and HP would work on a X to native PCL5 driver.

   It was probably the CDE 1.0 effect that left many people with the
   impression that Xprint is all about xwd-like window dumps. NO! Xprint
   has native PostScript and PCL5 printing and more drivers (like PDF and
   SVGprint DDXs etc.) are in the development.
   Myth: 

   " Xprint cannot handle non-'ISO Latin 1' chars "
   Fact:

   Xprint can print any chars incl. those required for MathML, Hebrew,
   Arabic, Japanese etc. etc. For example - the Xprint module for
   Mozilla5 is the only print module which can proprtly print MathML.
   Myth:

   " Xprint uses a 1024x768 screen resolution to render the stuff on the
   paper - therefore it will never be able to do high-resolution stuff "
   Fact:

   Xprt uses the screen resolution requested by the application or the
   printers default resolution. For example a 300 DPI printer which
   supports paper sizes up to DIN-A4 will get a screen with 3300x3300
   pixels (screen width and height are usually equal to support per-page
   changes in the orientation (potrait/landscape etc.), the window size
   would be 2400x3149 for "portrait" orientation) - and larger
   resolutions will result in larger screens.
   Myth: 

   " Xprint prints only graphics(=bitmap/gfx) fonts "
   Fact:

   In short, Xprt supports printer-builtin fonts and can download fonts
   to the printer if they do not exist on the printer.

   In long, this myth seems to have it's root in a feature of Xprt which
   can - if Xprt gets misconfigured - disable the use of printer-builtin
   fonts and the ability to download fonts.

   Xprt's PostScript and PCL DDX have the unique feature to create font
   glyphs from bitmap fonts if they are not available as printer-builtin
   fonts nor as outline fonts (OpenType, TrueType, PS Type1, etc.).
   However this is the fallback - the last option used by Xprt. Used if
   everything else fails. But when someone does not pass any outline
   fonts (such as OpenType, TrueType or PS Type1) fonts with the font
   path nor configures a printer model-config (which contains a
   description of the features&fonts supported by the printer) Xprt will
   never have a chance to use them. And if everything else fails it has
   no other option than using what has been left - the bitmap fonts...
   Myth: 

   " Xprint does not support pages sizes larger than DIN-A4 "
   Fact:

   There is no such limitation. The only limit is the 16bit coordinate
   system of the X11 protocol - which is large enougth that Xprint can
   support paper sizes larger than DIN-A0 oversize papers. There is no
   problem with creating your own monster-size DIN-A0 posters using
   Xprint-based applications.
   Myth: 

   " Xprint does not support rotated text "
   Fact:

   Xprint and all it's drivers support the X11 matrix XLFD enhancement
   introduced in X11R6 (and future versions of Xprint will support the
   [161]STSF font API which supports matrix transformations as well).
   Fonts can be rotated at any angle. Take a look at the [162]SOFTWARE
   DEVELOPMENT section in this FAQ for examples...
   Myth: 

   " The X11 rendering model is not good enougth for printers "
   Facts:

     * The default Xprint rendering model uses the X11 rendering model -
       which is "limited"... but only when compared with PostScript. But
       the attempt to compare Xprint with PostScript is like comparing
       apples and eggs - they have been designed with different goals in
       mind - PostScript as plain rendering language for printers and
       Xprint as integrated all-in-one solution to allow applications to
       print without having special knowledge about the OS, spooler,
       [163]PDL or printer.
     * Around 95% of the applications which have print support do not use
       any of the special features provided by rendering models like
       PostScript.
     * Xprint does not require that an application uses the X11 rendering
       model - they are free to generate their own PostScript code or
       PostScript fragments and pass it to the printer via the Xprint API
       or use the OpenGL rendering model via the GLX extension available
       in newer versions of the Xprint server.
     * Printing from Mozilla, Motif or the Qt toolkit using Xprint
       results in a much better quality than using the "native"
       PostScript generation code in those applications.
     * Xprint supports more [164]PDLs than PostScript - having a
       PostScript-specific rendering model would be limiting, and make it
       difficult to support other [165]PDLs.

   Q:

   Does Xprint support anti-aliased fonts ?
   A:

   Question back: When do we need anti-aliased fonts ? Anti-aliasing is a
   "hack" to work around the limitations caused by the low resolution of
   monitors - they usually operate between 72 DPI and 150 DPI.

   But Xprint operates on printers where the usual minimum resolution is
   300 DPI (today's normal office printers support resolutions ranging
   from 300 DPI up to 2400 DPI depending on the model; most common is 600
   DPI). Anti-aliasing at those resolutions is not required anymore.
   Additionally many printers support their own font anti-aliasing at
   lower resolutions which is far better and faster than it could be
   "done" on the client side.
   Q:

   How can I check if Xprint is working and should be used ?
   A:

   Check whether the ${XPSERVERLIST} env var is set or not. If
   ${XPSERVERLIST} is set then Xprint is available and should be used.
   Q:

   How can I view PS(=PostScript) files ?
   A:

     * On Unix/Linux (general):
          + GhostScript ("gs") and GhostView ("gv" and it's KDE- and
            Gnome-specific versions "kghostview" and "ggv")

     * Solaris:
          + /usr/dt/bin/sdtimage (DPS-based image viewer for CDE)
          + /usr/openwin/bin/pageview (DPS-based image viewer for
            OpenWindows)

   Q:

   How can I view PCL files ?
   A:

   XXX - [166]xprint.mozdev.org bug 2261 has been filed for that issue.
   Q:

   How does Xprt find fonts ?
   A:

   Lookup-rule for Xprt's PostScript DDX to find fonts:
    1. Printer-builtin fonts (defined by the fonts/-dir in the
       model-config)
    2. PostScript fonts (will be downloaded via generated print job)
    3. GFX-fonts build from X11 scaleable fonts
    4. GFX-fonts build from X11 bitmap fonts

   Q:

   How can I print TrueType fonts with Xprint ?
   A:

    1. Linux Xprt build from [167]http://xprint.mozdev.org/'s source
       supports TrueType fonts out-of-the-box (starting with the 008
       development tree; xprint.mozdev.org's releases <= 007 do not
       support TrueType fonts) and and does not require any special
       actions.
    2. Sun's Xprt on Solaris (/usr/openwin/bin/Xprt) has TrueType font
       support out-of-the-box and does not require any special actions.
    3. You can setup a TTF-aware X font server ("xfs", see xfs(1x)) with
       the matching TrueType fonts and add the font server location to
       Xprt's font path.
    4. Sourceforge has a TrueType to PostScript Type 1 converter project,
       see [168]http://ttf2pt1.sourceforge.net/download.html. You may
       convert the TTF files into PT1 files that Xprt can download them
       to the printer on demand...

   Q:

   What does "DDX" mean ?
   A:

   "DDX" is a short term for "Device Dependent X" - the device-specific
   layer of a Xserver ([169]"DIX"(="Device Independent X") is the
   counterpart).
   Q:

   What does "DIX" mean ?
   A:

   "DIX" is a short term for "Device Independent X" - the non-device
   specific code of a Xserver ([170]"DDX"(="Device Dependent X") is the
   counterpart).
   Q:

   What does "PDL" mean ?
   A:

   "PDL" is a short term for "Page Description Language". Examples for
   PDLs are PostScript, PCL, PDF and SVGprint.
   Q:

   I have twenty printers installed on my system - but Xprt only shows
   two screens. Where are all the other printers ?
   A:

   A Xprt screen does not represent a single printer. A Xprt screen
   represents a single DDX (currently supported are PostScript, PCL3/5
   color, PCL mono and "raster" output(=1bit deep bitmap).
   Q:

   Which platforms support Xprint ?
   A:

   All platforms which support X11 >= R6.4 can use Xprint. The client
   side (libXp.so) is available on Linux/FreeBSD(=Xfree86), Solaris,
   HP-UX and AIX and the Xprt server side is available by default on
   Solaris and HP-UX (Xfree86 shipps with a Xprt binary - but that is
   broken and unuseable). The client-side extension library (libXp.so)
   can be compiled on any platform, the Xprt server needs minor
   adjustments for the specific platforms... If your platform does not
   have Xprint (client-side and/or server-side) you can get the sources
   from [171]http://xprint.mozdev.org/.
   Q:

   I have the broken Xfree86 Xprt binary on my system. Do I need a new
   version of libXp.so (the client side X11 extension library for
   Xprint), too ?
   A:

   No, the libXp.so shared library shipped with Xfree86 or build from
   Xfree86 sources is not broken, only the server side ("Xprt") is buggy.
   There is no need to replace the library.
   Q:

   Which spelling is correct - "Xprint", "XPrint", "Xprinter" or Xprt" ?
   A:

   "Xprint" is the correct one - "XPrint" is just a typo, "Xprinter" is a
   complety different product not related to X11/Xprint and "Xprt" is
   only the "X11 print server"(=the server side of Xprint).
   Q:

   Which applications support Xprint ?
   A:

   There are various applications which support Xprint:
     * Motif/LessTif toolkits (full framework incl. special widgets like
       XmPrintShell)
     * Athena toolkit (full framework incl. special widgets like
       XawPrintShell, starting with X.org release 6.7.1)
     * [172]Common Desktop Environment (CDE) 2.x
     * [173]Mozilla, FireFox, ThunderBird, etc.
     * Eclipse
     * KDE/Qt support is planned for Q3/2004
     * StarOffice 5.x
     * etc.

   Q:

   Is "Xprint" "mozilla"-only (I saw that it's hosted by mozdev.org) ?
   A:

   No, Xprint is a general-purpose print API based on the X11 API used by
   many applications ([174]mozdev.org is just hosting the development
   area, but this does not mean the project is limited to mozilla... :)).
   Q:

   Under which license is the source code from xprint.mozdev.org
   distributed under ?
   A:

   That's the plain "MIT" license, the same as used by Xfree86.org and

   Q:

   Why does Xprint not use PPDs for configuration ?
   A:

   Xprint supports multiple "page description languages ([175]PDL)"
   including PostScript, PDF, PCL, etc. Therefore Xprint uses a different
   configuration file format which works with all these PDLs and not only
   PostScript (PPD files are PostScript-specific and cannot be used for
   other PDLs).

   There is currently a converter in development to convert a Adobe PPD
   file into Xprint's model-config format. See
   [176]xprint.freedesktop.org bug 636 ("RFE: Add an Adobe PPD to
   model-config converter / xpppdtomodelconfig") for further information.

          installed anywhere. What is that for a thing ?! 

   Q: [191]How can I forward Xprint services when logging-in via ssh to
          another machine ? 

   Q:

   How do I configure Xprint on the client side ?
   A:

   There are two env vars which control Xprint on the client side:
    1. The env variable ${XPSERVERLIST} contains a list of display
       identifiers (seperated by whitespace) to tell the application
       where it can find the Xprt servers. Usually ${XPSERVERLIST} is set
       by the profile startup scripts (e.g. /etc/profile or
       /etc/profile.d/xprint.sh) using the output of "/etc/init.d/xprint
       get_xpserverlist". Example:
  % export XPSERVERLIST="`/etc/init.d/xprint get_xpserverlist`"
       Alternativly ${XPSERVERLIST} can be set manually:
       Example:
  % export XPSERVERLIST="littlecat:80 bitdog:72"
       instructs an application to look at the displays 80 on the machine
       "littlecat" and display 72 on the machine bigdog to look for Xprt
       servers.
    2. The env variable ${XPRINTER} defines the default printer used by
       print applications. The syntax is either <printername> or
       <printername>@<display>
       Examples:
         a.
  % export XPRINTER=ps003
            tells an application to look for the first printer named
            "ps003" on all Xprt servers.
         b.
  % export XPRINTER="hplaser19@littlecat:80"
            tells an application to look for the printer "hplaser19" on
            the Xprt display "littlecat:80".

Note:
       If ${XPRINTER} is not set the applications will examine the values
       of the ${PDPRINTER}, ${LPDEST}, and ${PRINTER} env vars (in that
       order).

   Q:

   How do I start Xprt ?
   A:

    1. Linux RPM installations on Mandrake/RedHat/SuSE Linux: Binary RPM
       packages provided by xprint.mozdev.org (or based on the same
       source :) will install /etc/init.d/xprint and related glue (see
       [192][4]) automatically; after a reboot a Xprt instance will be
       started at system startup and ${XPSERVERLIST} should be populated
       for all users. Note that you can start/stop per-user instances
       using /etc/init.d/xprint (see [193][4]), too...
    2. Debian Linux: Same as [194][1], however Debian does not support
       /etc/profile.d/ - you have to add the following line to
       /etc/profile (for sh/ksh/bash) to populate ${XPSERVERLIST}:
  export XPSERVERLIST="`/bin/sh /etc/init.d/xprint get_xpserverlist`"
       See [195]bugs.debian.org bug 171174 ('"xprint-xprintorg" should
       automatically populate $XPSERVERLIST') for further details on this
       issue...
    3.
         a. Solaris using the "GISWxprintglue" package:
            [196]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ provides a Solaris package
            called "GISWxprintglue" which contains all the neccesary
            configuration files and startup scripts to use Xprint; after
            a reboot a Xprt instance will be started at system startup
            and ${XPSERVERLIST} should be populated for all users. Note
            that you can start/stop per-user instances using
            /etc/init.d/xprint (see [197][4]), too...
         b. Solaris using the "GISWxprint" package:
            [198]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ provides a Solaris package
            called "GISWxprint" which is technically identical to the
            "GISWxprintglue" (see [199][3a]) but provides a Xprt binary
            build from the xprint.mozdve.org sources ("GISWxprintglue"
            uses the /usr/openwin/bin/Xprt binary provided by Solaris).
    4. General: Using /etc/init.d/xprint and related glue: There are
       startup/shutdown scripts in xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/ to
       start/stop/restart Xprt per-machine and/or per-user and to
       populate the ${XPSERVERLIST} env var:
          + "xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/init.d/xprint" is a script
            for SystemV and Linux to start/stop/restart Xprt. The script
            includes installation and usage details and can be used by
            both "root" (to start Xprt for all users) or by a single
            (non-priviledged, plain) user (to start Xprt instances only
            for his/her own use)
          + "xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/profile.d/xprint.csh" and
            "xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/profile.d/xprint.sh" are
            scripts for Linux (which support /etc/profile.d/ ; note that
            this does not include Debian) to populate the ${XPSERVERLIST}
            env var for each user.
    5. Starting Xprt "manually" (without using /etc/init.d/xprint): Set
       the ${XPCONFIGDIR} env variable to the directory where Xprt can
       find it's configuration data.

WARNING
       If Xprt cannot find it's configuration data it will not be able to
       use printer-builtin fonts (which are defined by the model-config
       in the configuration dir). Without printer-builtin fonts Xprt may
       fall back to generate font glyphs from bitmap fonts (this resulted
       in the MYTH that "Xprt can only print gfx fonts". This is not TRUE
       - this only happens if Xprt is either misconfigured or no matching
       builtin or PS Type1 font is available).
       You may want to make a copy of the default configuration directory
       and modify it to match your needs.
    6. Starting Xprt is just as easy as starting any other Xserver:
  % Xprt :12
       will start Xprt on display 12 (e.g. set ${XPSERVERLIST} to ":12"
       or "myhostname:12".
       You may want to copy your framebuffer Xserver's font path to be
       able to print all fonts which can be displayed on that Xserver.
  % Xprt -fp $(xset q | awk "/Font Path:/ { i=1 ; next } i==1 { print \$0 ; i=0
 }") :12

Notes:

     * The /etc/init.d/xprint has a more advanched filtering scheme based
       on regex patters to "accept" and/or "reject" font paths
     * 'xset q | awk "/Font Path:/ { i=1 ; next } i==1 { print \$0 ; i=0
       }"' may be too simple-minded if your Xserver does not support
       TrueType fonts. The following statemement is better in this case
       since it filters the font path and removes all path elements which
       have TrueType fonts (*.ttf, *.TTF) or TrueType font collections
       (*.ttc, *.TTC) in fonts.dir:
  % xset q | awk "/Font Path:/ { i=1 ; next } i==1 { print \$0 ; i=0 }" |
   tr "," "\n" | while read i ; do \
  if [ "$(cat ${i}/fonts.dir | egrep -i "ttf|ttc" 2>/dev/null)" == "" ] \
  ; then echo $i ; fi ; done | (fontpath="" ; fpdelim=""; while read i ; \
  do fontpath=${fontpath}${fpdelim}${i} ; fpdelim="," ; done ; echo \
  $fontpath)
     * It may be easier to just feed all available font paths to Xprt
       (BTW: mozilla 1.0 had a bug in that case which resulted in the
       problem that it used many many bitmap fonts in that case - this
       has been fixed for 1.0.1 and Netscape 7 (that's the reason why the
       quickguides for hebrew/cyrillic use the "Xp_dummyfonts" fonts
       instead of /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/ - to avoid that
       Mozilla finds bitmap fonts for the same locale). The following
       "small" one-liner finds all fonts (except printer builtin fonts):
  % find /usr/openwin -name fonts.dir | while read i ; do echo
  ${i%/fonts.dir} ; done | fgrep -v "models/"
       Plug it into the filter above to remove the Truetype fonts and you
       are "done"... :)

   Q:

   How can I get a list of printers managed by Xprint ?
   A:

   The tool "xplsprinters" is designed for that purpose. It can deliver
   both list of printers and attributes supported for a specific list of
   printers. Use % xplsprinters -h # to obtain usage information.
   Example:
     * Get list of available printers:
% xplsprinters
printer: hplaserjet001@castor:19
printer: hpcolor001@castor:19
printer: laser1@jason:5
printer: david_dj01@jason:5
     * Get information about the supported attrbites of printer "ps002":
% xplsprinters -printer ps002 -l
printer: ps002@castor:18
        comment=
        model-identifier=HPDJ1600C
        default-medium=iso-a4
        default-input-tray=
        medium-source-sizes-supported=iso-a4 false 6.35 203.65 6.35 290.65
        medium-source-sizes-supported=na-letter false 6.35 209.55 6.35 273.05
        default-printer-resolution=300
        resolution=300
        default_orientation=
        orientation=portrait
        orientation=landscape
        default_plex=
        plex=simplex

   Q:

   How can I start Xprt at boot time ?
   A:

   "xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/init.d/xprint" is a script for SystemV
   and Linux to start/stop/restart Xprt at system startup (e.g.
   per-machine) or for a single user (e.g. per-user). The script includes
   installation and usage details.
   Q:

   How can I start Xprt per-user ?
   A:

   "xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/etc/init.d/xprint" is a script for SystemV
   and Linux to start/stop/restart Xprt at system startup (e.g.
   per-machine) or for a single user (e.g. per-user). The script includes
   installation and usage details.
   Q:

   How can I start Xprt only for one application ?
   A:

   Create your own version/copy of /etc/init.d/xprint and modify it to
   fit your requirements and then make sure that you issue a
   "my_xprint_startscript start" before starting the application and a
   "my_xprint_startscript stop" after leaving the application.
   Q:

   How can I filter the font path which should be passed to Xprt for
   certain fonts ?
   A:

   XXX
   Q:

   How can I manage access control to the Xprt server ?
   A:

   Access control to Xprt is not differently as to any other Xserver and
   can be handled in various ways - like per-cookie (using
   MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authentification), per-user (using SUN-DES-1 or
   MIT-KERBEROS-5 auth., see (see xhost(1x))) and/or per-machine (using
   "xhost" (see xhost(1x)) and/or /etc/X<dpy>.hosts (<dpy> == display
   number, e.g. /etc/X0.hosts for display 0) (see Xserver(1x))) Consult
   manual pages Xsecurity(7), xhost(1x), Xserver(1x) etc. for further
   details.
   Q:

   How can I log access to the Xprt server ?
   A:

   Logging access to Xprt can be done using the standard Xserver
   auditing, see the Xserver(1x) manual page, option "-audit"
   Q:

   Does it require "root" permissions to use Xprt/Xprint ?
   A:

   No, both Xprint clients and Xprint server(s) do not require root
   rights to work.

   Xprint clients are handled like any other X11 application and the Xprt
   servers can run without any special requirements. Solaris is an
   exception here since it requires to start any Xserver (incl. Xprt)
   setgid "root" (set-group-id "root", this is not set-user-id "root")
   since the sockets/pipe files in /tmp/.X11-pipe/ and /tmp/.X11-unix/
   are only accessible for the group "root". The workaround is to start
   Xprt with the option "-pn"; therefore even Xprt server binaries which
   are not setgid "root" can run without problems).
   Q:

   How can I see the attributes of a printer managed by Xprint ?
   A:

   "xplsprinters -printer myprinter004 -l" will do the job for printer
   "myprinter004".

   See xplsprinters(1x) for futher usage and a description of the output.
   Q:

   How can I list the font path used by a Xprt server ?
   A:

   Figure out the display id of the server which should be queried (we
   are using "foobar:98" in this example) and then try this:
% (DISPLAY=foobar:98 xset q | \
awk "/Font Path:/ { i=1 ; next } i==1 { print \$0 ; i=0 }" | \
tr "," "[\n]")
# Output may look like:
PRINTER:/usr/openwin/server/etc/XpConfig/C/print/models/HPDJ1600C/fonts/
PRINTER:/usr/openwin/server/etc/XpConfig/C/print/models/SPSPARC2/fonts/
PRINTER:/usr/openwin/server/etc/XpConfig/C/print/models/HPLJ3Si-PS/fonts/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/F3/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/F3bitmaps/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/

Note:

   Note that the font path items which start with "PRINTER:" are only be
   sourced after the matching printer has been selected and configured
   (for developers: After XpSetContext has been called).

   Q:

   "xset q" lists all model-specific font dirs (like
   PRINTER:/myxpcfg/C/print/models/SPSPARC2/fonts/") - is that a bug ?
   A:

   No, this is normal. Xprt will add all fonts of all printer models to
   the font path - but font path items starting with "PRINTER:" are only
   available for an application after the matching printer has been
   selected and configured (for developers: After XpSetContext has been
   called), before that point fonts in these dirs are not available for
   an application.
   Q:

   My application lists a printer called "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs"
   / "xp_pdf_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" / "spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" / in
   the print dialog but I do not have such a print queue installed
   anywhere. What is that for a thing ?!
   A:

   "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" and "xp_pdf_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs"
   ("spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" was the old, pre-009 name for
   "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs") are special Xprint printer targets
   which uses the "PSspooldir" / "PS2PDFspooldir-GS" printer models.
   These model config sends PostScript or PDF jobs to the
   /tmp/Xprintjobs/ directory instead to a physical printer (quite
   usefull for people who want to get the PostScript or PDF files as
   output instead of printed pages).

   References: 
     * [201]xprint.mozdev.org bug 5092 ("[PS2PDFspooldir-GS] RFE: Add
       printer model which sends PDF jobs to /tmp/Xprintjobs/")

   Q:

   How can I forward Xprint services when logging-in via ssh to another
   machine ?
   A:

   You have to forward the X11 connection for the Xprint server(s) to the
   remote system and set the XPSERVERLIST variable to direct the Xprint
   clients to the forwarded ports.

   Example 1. Login to a remote host using slogin (assuming there is only
   one Xprint server listed in XPSERVERLIST)
% echo $XPSERVERLIST
west:33

   Add 6000 to the display number ("33" in this example) to get the port
   number (X11 port numbers start at port 6000. 6000 is display number
   "0", 6001 is display number 6001 and so on) and then ask slogin to
   forward the port:
% slogin -R6033:west:6033 -l nrubsig puzzle

nrubsig's password:
Last login: Fri Jan 23 04:05:06 2004 from west.informatik.med.uni-giessen.de
Have a lot of fun...

   Then set the XPSERVERLIST env var on the remote host to the forwarded
   ports and you are done:
% export XPSERVERLIST="localhost:33 ${XPSERVERLIST}"

   Example 2. Login to a remote host using slogin (assuming there are
   multiple Xprint servers listed in XPSERVERLIST)

   The following small shell script will process the XPSERVERLIST env var
   and output the parameters for calling slogin/ssh with all Xprint
   server ports forwarded:
#!/bin/ksh
# xp_print_slogin_args.ksh
# Small example which parses $XPSERVERLIST and prints out how slogin/ssh
# should be used to forward all local Xprint servers

PORTARGS=""
REMOTE_XPSERVERLIST=""
spacer="" # seperator
remoteport=6100
remotedisplaynum=100

echo "${XPSERVERLIST}" | tr " " "\n" |
    while read i ; do
        [ "$i" = "" ] && continue
        displaynum="${i##*:}"
        port="$(( ${displaynum} + 6000 ))"
        hostname="${i%:*}"
        PORTARGS="${PORTARGS}${spacer}-R${remoteport}:${hostname}:${port}"
        REMOTE_XPSERVERLIST="${REMOTE_XPSERVERLIST}${spacer}localhost:${remoted
isplaynum}"

        spacer=" "
        remoteport=$((${remoteport} + 1))
        remotedisplaynum=$((${remotedisplaynum} + 1))
    done
echo "Log in with: % slogin ${PORTARGS} -l myloginname myremotehost"
echo "Set remote XPSERVERLIST with % export XPSERVERLIST=\"${REMOTE_XPSERVERLIS
T} \${XPSERVERLIST}\""
# EOF.

   Example usage:
% xp_print_slogin_args.ksh

   will print
Log in with: % slogin -R6100:west:6033 -R6101:north:6033 -l myloginname myremot
ehost
Set remote XPSERVERLIST with % export XPSERVERLIST="localhost:100 localhost:101
 ${XPSERVERLIST}"

   Q:

   How do I change the defaults for double-sided/single-sided/etc.
   printing ?
   A:

   This is controlled via the "plex" attribute in the document attribute
   pool (${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/document and/or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document). Examples:
    1. Adding/modifying the following line to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default plex
       for all printers to "duplex":
  *plex: duplex
    2. Adding/modifying the following two lines to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default plex
       for all printers to "duplex" except for printer "ps003" which
       should default to "simplex":
  *plex: duplex
  ps003.plex: simplex

Notes:

     * Not all printers support all plex modes. The model-config may
       restrict the available plex modes.
     * Setting a plex mode which is not supported by either the
       DDX(=driver) or not specified in the model-config will cause Xprt
       to not set a default plex.
     * The PostScript DDX supports plex modes "simplex", "duplex" and
       "tumble".
     * Verification: Use
  xplsprinters -l | egrep "^printer:|default_plex=|plex="
       to view the plex settings for all printers.

   Q:

   I am in America and I don't have any ISO A4 paper. How do I change the
   default paper size to 8.5 inch x 11 inch (US-Letter) ?
   A:

   This is controlled via the "default-medium" attribute in the document
   attribute pool (${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/document
   and/or ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document). Examples:
    1. Adding/modifying the following line to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default paper
       size for all printers to "na-letter":
  *default-medium: na-letter
    2. Adding/modifying the following two lines to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default paper
       size for all printers to "na-letter" except for printer "ps003"
       which should default to "iso-a4":
  *default-medium: na-letter
  ps003.default-medium: iso-a4

Notes:

     * xprint.mozdev.org releases >= 007 provides a seperate "document"
       attribute pool for en_US(-like) locales (see
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/en_US/print/attributes/document) which will
       override the default ISO-A4 with US-Letter (this feature assumes
       that ${LANG} is set to "en_US" (or a locale which has similar
       defaults as "en_US", those are currently linked to "en_US" in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/))
     * Not all printers support all paper sizes. The model-config may

   Q:

   How do I change the default printer resolution ?
   A:

   This is controlled via the "default-printer-resolution" attribute in
   the document attribute pool
   (${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/document and/or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document). Examples:
    1. Adding/modifying the following line to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default
       resolution for all printers to 600 DPI:
  *default-printer-resolution: 600
    2. Adding/modifying the following two lines to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default
       resolution for all printers to 300 DPI except for printer
       "tekcolor_ps" which should default to 1200 DPI:
  *default-printer-resolution: 300
  tekcolor_ps.default-printer-resolution: 1200

Notes:

     * Not all printers support all resolutions. The model-config may
       restrict the available resolutions.
     * Setting a resolution which is not supported by either the
       DDX(=driver) or not specified in the model-config will cause Xprt

       to view the resolution settings for all printers.

   Q:

   How do I change the default settings for
   "portrait"/"landscape"/"seascape" (=page orientation) ?
   A:

   This is controlled via the "content-orientation" attribute in the
   document attribute pool
   (${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/document and/or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document). Examples:
    1. Adding/modifying the following line to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default
       orientation for all printers to "portrait":
  *content-orientation: portrait
    2. Adding/modifying the following two lines to/in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document sets the default
       orientation for all printers to "portrait" except for printer
       "ps003" which should default to "landscape":
  *content-orientation: portrait
  ps003.content-orientation: landscape

Notes:

     * Not all printers support all orientations. The model-config may
       restrict the available orientations.
     * Setting an orientation which is not supported by either the
       DDX(=driver) or not specified in the model-config will cause Xprt
       to not set a default orientation.
     * The PostScript DDX supports the following orientations:
       "portrait", "landscape", "reverse-portrait" and
       "reverse-landscape".
     * Verification: Use
  xplsprinters -l | egrep "^printer:|default_orientation=|orientation="
       to view the orientation settings for all printers.

   Q:

   How can I prevent Xprt from using any bitmap(=gfx) fonts ?
   A:

   Do not pass any bitmap fonts with the "-fp" (=font path) argument.
   However you have to provide a 'fixed' and a 'cursor' font, a Xserver
   can't start without having these fonts.

   Procedure 1. Task list:
    1. Create a new directory:
% mkdir Xp_dummyfonts
% cd Xp_dummyfonts
    2. Create a fonts.alias file with the following content:
! alias for "fixed" font
! original from /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias looks like this:
! fixed   "-misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1"
fixed -*-r-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
! EOF.
    3. Copy or link "6x13.pcf.Z" and "cursor.pcf.Z" and create fonts.dir
% ln -s /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/6x13.pcf.Z .
% ln -s /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf.Z .
% mkfontdir $PWD
    4. Verify: The directory should now look like this:
% ls -1
6x13.pcf.Z
cursor.pcf.Z
fonts.alias
fonts.dir
    5. Add the full path (e.g. /home/xp/Xp_dummyfonts) as last element of
       the font path when starting Xprt:
  % Xprt -fp /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/,/home/xp/Xp_dummyfonts :12

   Q:

   I want only my manually added printers managed by Xprint. How can I
   prevent Xprt from looking-up the printer names automatically ?
   A:

   Add a line with "Augment_Printer_List %none%" to
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters (or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/Xprinters) and add lines with "Printer
   <name>" for each printer <name>. Example:
Augment_Printer_List %none%
Printer ps001
Printer ps003
Printer hplaser6

   will add only the printers "ps001", ps003" and "hplaser6".
   Q:

   How can I specify an own program/script to enumerate the printers on
   my system ?
   A:

   Add "Augment_Printer_List my_script" to
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters (or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/Xprinters). The script must return the
   printer names - one per line, ASCII-only - to stdout.
   Q:

   Which program is used by default by Xprt to enumerate the printers on
   my system ?
   A:

   This depends on the OS:
     * On Solaris (and most other OSes exclusing AIX and Linux):
% lpstat -a | cut -d " " -f 1
     * On Linux:
          + For Xprt build from X11R6.x X.org sources:
% lpc status | grep -v '^\t' | sed -e /:/s/// # '\t' means TAB
          + For Xprt build from xprint.mozdev.org <= release 008 sources
            (both lines are executed to support both LPRng and CUPS
            (using the CUPS *BSD compatibility tools)):
% lpc status | awk '/:$/ && !/@/ { print $1 }' | sed -e /:/s/// ; \
  lpc -a status | awk '/@/ && !/:/ { split( $1, name, \"@\" ); print name[1]; }
'
          + Xprt build from xprint.mozdev.org >= release 009 sources uses
            a more flexible scheme which tries to enumerate the print
            spoolers in the order "CUPS" (using the normal CUPS
            (SYSV-like) commands), "LPRng" and finally "*BSD", the first
            working (=print queues are found) print spooler is chosen.
            The spooler(s) being used (and the query order) can be
            changed by the "-XpSpoolerType" command line option. The list
            of commands used to enumerate the queues for a specific
            spooler type can be found in
            xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/spooler.c
     * On AIX v4:
% lsallq | grep -v '^bsh$'

Notes:

     * See xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/Init.c (xprint.mozdev.org >=
       release 009 uses xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/spooler.c) for a
       complete list of commands used on the specific platforms to
       enumerate the printers.
     * Note that the output is always piped through "sort" to get an
       alphabetical order (the "default" printer is not chosen/defined
       here(=server side), the client side is responsible to choose a
       default printer. See FAQ item about the ${XPRINTER} env var how to
       set your default printer).

   Q:

   Where can I get more PostScript Type1 fonts from ?
   A:

   Some sources:
     * Adobe:

          + Free Euro font:

   Q:

   What are PMF fonts (e.g. the *.pmf fonts in
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/%model_name%/fonts/ (or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/%model_name%/fonts/)) ?
   A:

   PMF "fonts" are "printer metric files" (.pmf) that describe the
   metrics of the fonts (which means they do not contain any data to
   render the fonts - they contain only the plain metrics of a font)
   which are built into the printer (ROM or via font catridge etc.). The
   file format is identical to the PCF ("Portable Compiled Format") font
   format except that the bitmap data is not provided.
   Q:

   Can I use the fontserver ("xfs") with Xprt ?
   A:

   You can use Xprt with the font server ("xfs") like with any other
   Xserver - but it is not recommded since the font server protocol does
   not allow access to the native font format and therefore disables font
   download, e.g. both PS Type1 and TrueType fonts cannot be downloaded
   anymore and Xprt will fall-back to embed them as bitmap glyphs in the
   print job (e.g. the fonts will still appear correctly in the printout,
   but the quality may be reduced since downloaded fonts are always
   better than bitmap glyphs). (users of xprint.mozdev.org-release <= 006
   may see [227]xprint.mozdev.org bug 2092 if they use "xfs"; this has
   been fixed in the 007 release!)
   Q:

   What is a "model-config" ?
   A:

   The term "model-config" refers to the subdirs in
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/. There subdirs contain
   information about the attributes for a specific printer model or
   family/class of printer models. In particular there are two kinds of
   information:
     * "${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/${NAME_OF_MODEL}/model-config
       " this file defines a set of attributes supported by this specific
       printer (-family/-class/etc.) and
     * "${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/${NAME_OF_MODEL}/fonts/" - a
       directory which contains a set of PMF (printer metrics file) fonts
       builtin into the printer itself (actually the PMF "font" format
       contains only metrics information and no glyphs). These fonts are
       only available to the application after the application has
       selected a printer and configured it (for developers: After
       XpSetContext has been called).

   Q:

   Where can I store the default values for printers ?

   XXX
   Q:

   How can I create my own model-config ?
   A:

   XXX
   Q:

   How can I create my own PMF "fonts" ?
   A:

   XXX - no solution yet, but [228]xprint.mozdev.org bug 2430 ("RFE: Need
   tool to create PMF (printer metrics file) fonts") has been filed to
   create a freeware tool to create such fonts.
   Q:

   Where can I get more model-configs from ?
   A:

   If you miss a model-config for your printer please open a bug/RFE at
   [229]http://xprint.freedesktop.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=xpri
   nt&component=Server%3A+Config%3A+model-configs (e.g.
   [230]http://xprint.freedesktop.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi, product
   "Xprint", component "Server Config: model-configs").
   Q:

   If I install Xprt &co. as "root" in the default location and don't
   need to set ${XPCONFIGDIR} - where are my configuration files located
   then ?
   A:

   This is platform-specific, based on the "XPrintDir" Imake variable set
   at build time. Default location for plain X11R6.x is
   "${XProjectRoot}/lib/X11/xserver" (set at build time), but some
   platforms modify "XPrintDir" to alternate locations:
     * Solaris sets ${XPCONFIGDIR} to /usr/openwin/server/etc/XpConfig/
     * Linux (non-Debian) sets ${XPCONFIGDIR} to
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xserver/ or /etc/X11/xserver/
     * Debian Linux sets ${XPCONFIGDIR} to /usr/share/Xprint/xserver/

Tip

   If you don't know where the default location for ${XPCONFIGDIR} is
   located try
  strings -a /usr/openwin/bin/Xprt | grep XPRINTDIR

   - it may return some debug info from the binary containing the builtin
   XpConfig path.

   Q:

   Are config files and/or the PMF fonts architecture dependent ?
   A:

   The PMF fonts are a variant of the PCF font format, they are (like the
   PCF format) architecture-independent. These fonts must be kept
   together with the other model config data since they depend on the
   printer model (de facto ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/ (and/or
   ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/) should be supplied by the
   printer vendors (but most people will create their own models on
   demand since I doubt that any vendor except HP, Sun and
   xprint.mozdev.org staff ever looked at that stuff)). Per definition
   they are read-only data supplied by the vendor, but modifying them may
   be usefull, too. I would say it is recommended to put treat all Xprint
   files in ${XPCONFIGDIR} as read-only vendor data; admins should create
   copies of this tree on demand (and/or (soft-)link some files) and set
   ${XPCONFIGDIR} to the modified config data.
   Q:

   Can I localise my Xprint/Xprt configuration (l10n) ?
   A:

   Yes, Xprt supports localisation ("l10n") by default. Default values
   for all locales are stored in ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/, locale-specific
   settings can be set in ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/ Rules:
     * Attribute pools ("${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/attributes/document",
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/attributes/job",
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/attributes/printer" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/models/*/model-config"): "document", "job"
       and "printer" attribute pools and printer model-configs are
       sourced first from the "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/"-directory, then
       they are overridden by any attributes from the locale-specific
       pools (in "${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/"), e.g. any values set in
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/*" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/*/model-config" will automatically
       apply to all other locales unless they are overridden by
       locale-specific versions of these files
       ("${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/*",
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/models/*/model-config")
     * "Xprinters" (list of printers): If there is a locale-specific
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/Xprinters present it will be used instead
       of ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/Xprinters (e.g. values set in
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/Xprinters will be ignored and the values from
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/Xprinters will be used instead).
     * Xprt will determinate the locale which should be used based on the
       ${LANG}-environment vaiable at startup time. If there is no such
       variable set at that time LANG="C" is assumed.

Note:
       Attribute values for paper names and orientation names refer to
       builtin strings in the DDX code (which are itself based on
       international standards), these cannot be changed to your own
       "inventions" (it does it make sense to try to "localize" paper
       names - "ISO-A4" is "ISO-A4" even in japanese/hebrew/german etc.).
       Locale-spefific attribute pools can set their own, different
       values - but only within the allowed range of values supported by
       the DDX and printers's model-config.

   Q:

   Can I execute my own scripts to process the PostScript files generated
   by Xprt ?
   A:

   Yes, there are at least two possible solutions:
    1. Create your own model-config which uses a custom
       "xp-spooler-command" value - the xprint.mozdev.org's "PSspooldir"
       model config (see "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/PSspooldir/" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters") and "PS2PDFspooldir-GS" model
       config (see "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/PS2PDFspooldir-GS/" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer" and
       "${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters") are good examples for that.
    2. Use an existing "model-config" (which would normally send it's
       data to a printer using the default print spooler command) and
       provide a custom "xp-spooler-command".

     Procedure 2.  Example (using "SPSPARC2" as printer model,
     /w/xp_conv as the script to execute and "myscriptprinter" as name
     of the printer): 
         1. Edit ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer and add these
            lines (Xprt will replace "%printer-name%" with the printer's
            name, "%copy-count%" with the number of job copies,
            "%job-name%" with the job's title and "%options%" with any
            custom spooler options):
myscriptprinter.xp-model-identifier: SPSPARC2
myscriptprinter.xp-spooler-command: /w/xp_conv -p %printer-name% -c %copy-count
% -t %job-name% -o "%options%"
         2. Edit ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters and append this line:
Printer myscriptprinter

   Q:

   How can I disable "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" /
   "xp_pdf_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" printer targets ?
   A:

   Edit ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters and remove or comment-out (using
   '#') the lines "Printer xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" and "Printer
   xp_pdf_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs".

Note:

   Note that Xprt will NOT start if this printer has been
   removed/disabled and no other print queue is available (e.g. if
   "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" and "Printer
   xp_pdf_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" are the only printer target
   available).

   Q:

   "Printing itself works but the printout covers only 1/4 of the paper -
   what am I doing wrong ?"
   A:

   This is usually an indicator for a wrong DPI setting. The default
   "PSdefault" model config uses 300 DPI but some printers only support
   600 DPI.

   Workaround:  Edit ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document and
   replace the line "*default-printer-resolution: 300" with
   "*default-printer-resolution: 600" (Note that locale-specific settings
   in ${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/attributes/document always override
   values set in ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/document.)

   Solution:  Create a model-config for your printer which only contains
   attributes supported by your printer ("printer-resolutions-supported"
   is the attribute in the "model-config" which holds the space-seperated
   list of DPI values which are supported by the printer).
   Q:

   "Printing works but I get large borders/margins..." / "[Top] margin is
   too small" / "Margins are wrong" / etc.
   A:

   Two possible causes:
     * Usually same issue as "Printing itself works but the printout
       covers only 1/4 of the page"-issue: Wrong DPI. Solution: Check the
       DPI value and adjust it as described in the FAQ item above. Common
       DPI values for the PostScript DDX are 240, 300, 360, 400 and 600
       DPI.
     * You are trying to print "US-letter" on a "DIN-A4" paper or
       "DIN-A4" on "US-letter".
       Solution: Check your paper settings
       Note that the default papersize for Xprt depends on the locale
       (e.g. on the env var ${LANG}) Xprt is running in - "en_US"&co. get
       US-letter, all others use DIN-A4 (incl. german/austrian etc.
       locales)). Exception from this rule: If the selected printer does
       not support the default paper size it will set no default paper
       size for this printer (then the application side has to make an
       explicit choice).

   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "sh: lpc: command not found" on
   my Linux machine. What does that mean ?
   A:

   Some versions of Xprt look up printer queues using "lpc" on Linux. In
   this case "lpc" cannot be found for some reason. Solution: Find the
   place where "lpc" is installed on your machine (some distributions put
   it into /usr/sbin, some into /usr/bin/) and check whether your PATH
   env var includes this directory. Example (if "lpc" is located in
   /usr/sbin/):
  % which lpc
  /usr/sbin/lpc
  % export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
  # Start Xprt ...
  % Xprt <your-options-come-here>

   Q:

   When the application (=client side) tries to connect to the Xprt
   (Xserver) side it fails with a
Xlib: connection to "meridian:52.0" refused by server
Xlib: Client is not authorized to connect to Server

   What does that mean ?
   A:

   X11 implements access control. You can have host-based, cookie-based
   (a "cookie" is used like a passport) or user-based (SecureRPC or
   Kerberos5) authentification. Xsecurity(7) has most of the details.
    1. No access control: .  If you do not want to use access control for
       Xprt then you can start it with the option "-ac" (see Xserver(1x))
       to disable the access control. Example:
  % Xprt -ac -audit 4 :12
       will start Xprt with access control disabled and with auditing
       enabled (e.g. the "-audit 4" option).

WARNING
       Disabling the access control will enable everyone who can access
       Xprt to print on your printers (that's why the above example shows
       how to use auditing, too - that you can see who does something
       with Xprt...) !!
    2. Host-based access control: .  Host-based access control can be
       archived using /etc/X<dpy>.hosts (<dpy> == display number, e.g.
       /etc/X0.hosts for display 0 (see Xserver(1x) manual page for
       further details)).

     Procedure 3. Example
         1. Add the following line to `/etc/X12.hosts' (assuming you want
            that the hosts 'merkur' and 'mars' should be able to access
            the Xprt server running as display 12 on your host 'neptun'):
INET:merkur
INET:mars
         2. Start Xprt
         3. Verify that Xprt is correctly configured:
% export DISPLAY=neptun:12
% xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
INET:localhost
LOCAL:
INET:merkur
INET:mars

   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "failed to set default font
   path '...' Fatal server error: could not open default font 'fixed'".
   What does that mean ?
   A:

   This means one or more components in the font path (set via the option
   "-fp") are either...
     * ... not valid
     * ... contain fonts not supported by this Xserver (e.g. support has
       not be compiled "in" (usually happens for TrueType (which are only
       support for Solaris version of Xprt and xprint.mozdev.org releases
       >= 008), OpenType (which are only supported by xprint.mozdev.org
       releases 009 or higher) or F3 fonts (Sunsoft/F3 fonts are
       Solaris-specific and not supported by other vendors (AFAIK)) when
       support for these fonts was not enabled at build time))
     * ... no font or font alias in the font path matches the name
       "fixed"
     * ... an entry in fonts.dir or fonts.alias with the name "fixed"
       which references a non-existing or non-readable file

   Q:

   Just copying my fonts into a directory and adding the path to my Xprt
   command line didn't work - I always get "Fatal server error: could not
   open default font 'fixed'". What am I doing wrong ?
   A:

   Every Xserver needs an index file called fonts.dir to tell it which
   fonts are available in this directory and which properties these fonts
   have.

   If you are lucky there may be already a fonts.scale file which can be
   used by "mkfontdir" to create the fonts.dir file. If there is no
   fonts.scale then you have to create your own fonts.dir/fonts.scale
   either by hand or via tools like "mkfontscale" (works for all types of
   scaleable fonts), "type1inst" (for PS Type1 fonts; see
   [255]http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/type1inst.html) or
   "ttmkfdir" (for TrueType fonts; see
   [256]http://packages.debian.org/stable/x11/ttmkfdir.html).
   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "Fatal server error: Cannot
   establish any listening sockets - Make sure an X server isn't already
   running". What does that mean ?
   A:

   There is already a Xserver running at the display ID you have
   specified to start Xprt (for example your framebuffer Xserver runs at
   ":0" then Xprt can't run at the same display display).
   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "Fatal server error: Failed to
   establish all listening sockets". What does that mean ?
   A:

   This means that the Xserver could not open one of it's sockets. Check
   the permission of /tmp/.X11-pipe and /tmp/.X11-unix (on Solaris a
   Xserver must run set-gid "root" to access these directories). Either
   fix the permission or start Xprt with the option "-pn". Using this
   option requires to access the server always with
   <hostname>:<displaynum> (see Xserver(1x) manual page for the
   side-effects of this option).
   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "Fatal server error: could not
   open default font 'fixed'" or "Fatal server error: could not open
   default cursor font 'cursor'".
   A:

   All Xservers at least two fonts as the minimum: One fixed-width font
   ("fixed") and one font for the cursor ("cursor"). Be sure that the
   font path contains these fonts.
   Q:

   Xprt refuses to start with the message "Fatal server error: no screens
   found". What does that mean ?
   A:

   Cause:  This means that Xprt could not find any printers. Either there
   are no printers installed, "lpstat"/"lpc" could not find any printers
   or the configuration does not contain any manual printer
   configurations (see Q/A item "Which program is used by default by Xprt
   to enumerate the printers on my system" for further details...).

   Solution:  Two solutions:
    1. Using "PSspooldir" model: .  Xprt releases from
       [257]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ provide the "PSspooldir" model
       config for such cases. Just edit the "Xprinters" file and add this
       line:
Printer xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs
       this will add the pre-configured (see
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer)
       "xp_ps_spooldir_tmp_Xprintjobs" printer which will send jobs to
       the directory "/tmp/Xprintjobs/" instead to a printer queue. (This
       feature was added in the xprint.mozdev.org release 007, see
       [258]xprint.mozdev.org bug 2475 ("RFE: Need model-config which
       spools print jobs in a predefined directory").)
    2. Manual setup (task list): . 

         1. Provide a simple "Xprinters" spec file which contains a dummy
            queue. Example:
# Create "Xprinters_onlydummy" file which turns autolookup of printers
# OFF (using "Augment_Printer_List %none%") and provides one dummy
# queue called "ps_myscript" instead (using "Printer ps_myscript")
% echo "Augment_Printer_List %none%" >Xprinters_onlydummy
% echo "Printer ps_myscript"         >>Xprinters_onlydummy
         2. Edit ${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/attributes/printer and add these
            two lines:
ps_myscript.xp-model-identifier: PSdefault
ps_myscript.xp-spooler-command: /home/sanja/xprint_test/my_xprt_cat_script.sh
            This means that the printer "ps_myscript" now uses the
            "PSdefault" printer model and it will feed the jobs to the
            script "/home/sanja/xprint_test/my_xprt_cat_script.sh" (via
            stdin). Note that the absolute path is required for
            "*xp-spooler-command".
         3. Start Xprt on display 18, passing the "Xprinters_onlydummy"
            using the "-XpFile" option:
% Xprt -XpFile ./Xprinters_onlydummy -pn -ac -audit 4 :18

   Q:

   Xprt prints a warning like "Xp Extension: could not find config dir
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/C/print" - what does that mean ?
   A:

   This is actually the worst case what can happen. The message indicates
   that Xprt was unable to find it's configuration data.

   Solution:  Two solutions are possible:
     * Install the configuration data at the requested location
       (/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/C/print/ in this example)
     * Set the ${XPCONFIGDIR} env var to the location of the Xprt
       configuration directory.

   Q:

   Xprt crashes with "Fatal server error: Beziers this big not yet
   supported" What does that mean ?
   A:

   This is a known issue in the X11R6.5.1 code. In rare cases some
   PostScript Type1 fonts can trigger this. See "My PS Type1 font does
   not work with my Xserver" ...
   Q:

   "My PS Type1 font does not work with my Xserver - how can I fix this
   ?"
   A:

   Some PS Type1 do not work out-of-the-box with all PS Type1 font
   engines - some will work with the Adobe font engine (used in Solaris
   Xsun) but not with the X.org font engine (or the other way round) or
   the fonts are simply broken. The following procedure will try to fix
   this problem: Get the "type1fix" perl script the TeXTrace package
   ([259]http://www.inf.bme.hu/~pts/textrace-latest.tar.gz) and run it
   over the fonts. Example 1 (filter fonts):
# Broken PFA fonts are in broken_fonts/
% mkdir fixed_fonts ; cd fixed_fonts
% for i in ../broken_fonts/*.pfa ; do
    echo " ------- $i" ;
    type1fix.pl --ofmt=pfa --infile=$i --outfile=$(basename ${i}) ;
  done

   Example 2 (filter fonts and convert them to PFB on-the-fly; do not
   forget to update fonts.scale and run "mkfontdir" (to update fonts.dir)
   ; systems which use the Adobe font engine (like Solaris/Xsun) may
   require to run "makepsres", too):
# Broken PFA fonts are in broken_fonts/
% mkdir fixed_fonts ; cd fixed_fonts
% for i in ../broken_fonts/*.pfa ; do
    echo " ------- $i" ;
    type1fix.pl --ofmt=pfb --infile=$i --outfile=$(basename ${i%.pfa}.pfb) ;
  done

   Q:

   I can't get it working. I have set ${DISPLAY} correctly to point to
   the Xprt display and... ... What is going wrong ?
   A:

   Do not set ${DISPLAY} to the Xprt server. You still need your normal
   Xserver for your video card - Xprt is only for your printer(s).
   Applications look up Xprt servers via the ${XPSERVERLIST} env var, NOT
   via the ${DISPLAY} env var.
   Q:

   When I try to print via Xprint I get the message "Fatal server error:
   unable to exec '/usr/bin/lp'". What is going wrong here ?
   A:

   This usually means that the spooler application "/usr/bin/lp" could
   not be launched. This is usually the result when /usr/bin/lp does not
   exist or cannot be executed (for example, shell scripts without the +x
   (executable) flag etc.).
   Q:

   The Solaris Xprt prints some error messages about PostScript fonts
   like "FOOBAR not found, using Courier. CMEX0123 not found, using
   Courier." etc. and uses "Courier" instead of these fonts...
   A:

   Cause:  The Solaris (Adobe-based) PostScript font engine requires a
   "PostScript resource database" file named "PSres.upr" to use the
   PostScript fonts correctly.

   Solution:  Create the missing PSres.upr database.

   Procedure 5. Steps to create the missing "PSres.upr" file (task list):
    1. Go to the location where the matching fonts are installed (we're
       using /home/sanja/mathml_fonts/tex_cmps/Type1/ in this example):
% cd /home/sanja/mathml_fonts/tex_cmps/Type1//
    2. Create "PSres.upr" using the "makepsres" command.
% makepsres
    3. Validation: Make sure the file has been created:
% ls -l PSres.upr
    4. Restart Xprt server(s):
% /etc/init.d/xprint restart
    5. Restart application which uses these fonts

   References:

       CMEX10/CMSY10 Type1 fonts")

       fonts to work on Solaris")

   Q:

   "Xprt refused to start, complaining about a missing dir
   (/etc/X11/xserver/C/print/ directory)... I created it by hand (empty)
   and started Xprt but it still does not work properly..."
   A:

   Xprt expects some config data in this directory. Just making it an
   existing but empty dir will work around the error message but will not
   result in a properly working Xprt since it has no (usefull) builtins
   which would make it possible to run the binary without the config
   data. Your X11 binary distribution should always come with the config
   data (for example /usr/openwin/server/etc/XpConfig/ on Solaris) or you
   will not be able to use Xprint (however it is possible to copy the
   config data from another system :) BTW: Source for the configs can be
   found under xc/programs/Xserver/XpConfig/
   Q:

   My Linux system already shipps with a '/usr/X11R6/bin/Xprt'-binary. Do
   I need the binary distribution from [262]http://xprint.mozdev.org/ ?
   A:

   This depends on what is shipped with your Linux distribution. Please
   check the "vendor" string of the Xprt server:
% Xprt :10 &
% xdpyinfo -display :10 | grep -i "vendor string"

   If this outputs a line like "vendor string: The XFree86 Project, Inc"
   then you have the Xprt binary build from Xfree86 sources - which are
   broken - even the newest version [I'll update this as soon as Xfree86
   shipps with a working version]. Xprt from Solaris, HP-UX and my own
   builds (which identifies itself as "vendor string: xprint.mozdev.org"
   for releases >= 007, older releases (e.g. <= 006) identify itself as
   as "vendor string: The X.Org Group") are known to work proprtly.
   Q:

   I am getting the error message "error opening security policy file
   /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xserver/SecurityPolicy". What does that mean ?
   A:

   The policy file for the SECURITY extension cannot be found. This is
   not serious unless you want to make use of features of the SECURITY
   extensions (like treating clients as "untrusted", e.g. restrict their
   access to certain Xserver resources). Normally the missing policy file
   is a problem with your Unix/Linux X11 distribution; consult your
   vendor where to get the missing file from. Alternatively you can get
   the plain X11R6.6 security policy file from
   [263]ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.6/xc/programs/Xserver/Xext/SecurityPolicy
   (copy it to the matching location - but be sure that you do not
   overwrite any existing security policy file).
   Q:

   I have modified the "HPLJ4family" [or "HPDJ1600C" etc.] printer model
   to work with my PostScript printer, but when I print I get empty
   places where some text should be - what am I doing wrong here ?
   A:

   The "HPLJ4family" and "HPDJ1600C" models are PCL-only, check the
   model-config spec
   (${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/models/${MODEL_NAME}/model-config) - if the
   "xp-ddx-identifier" attribute says something with "PCL" (like
   "XP-PCL-MONO" etc.) in the value string then this model-config is for
   the PCL-DDX only (e.g. their PMF fonts do not supply the neccesary
   information (e.g. the "_ADOBE_POSTSCRIPT_FONTNAME" chunk is missing;
   they only provide the "PCL_FONT_NAME" chunk) nor are these fonts
   accessible via the PostScript-support in these printers. A solution is
   to use the "PSdefault" model instead (and/or create your customized
   own version of this model) - or look if there is a model-config
   beginning with the same name and ending with "PS" (e.g.
   "HPLJ4family-PS").
   Q:

   Xprt outputs warning messages like:

Xp Extension: Can't load driver XP-PCL-MONO
              init function missing
Xp Extension: Can't load driver XP-RASTER
              init function missing

   What does that mean ?
   A:

   Two possible problems:
    1. The requested driver is not supported by that version of Xprt. For
       example Solaris 2.7 Xprt does not support XP-PCL-MONO nor the
       XP-RASTER driver. Valid values for the "xp-ddx-identifier"
       attribute in ${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/attributes/printers and/or
       ${XPCONFIGDIR}/*/print/models/*/model-config are
          + Solaris 2.7: XP-POSTSCRIPT and XP-PCL-COLOR
          + Solaris >=2.8: XP-POSTSCRIPT, XP-PCL-COLOR, XP-PCL-MONO and
            XP-RASTER
          + HP-UX: XP-POSTSCRIPT, XP-PCL-COLOR, XP-PCL-MONO, XP-PCL-LJ3,
            XP-PCL-DJ1200 and XP-RASTER
          + xprint.mozdev.org release 007: XP-POSTSCRIPT and XP-RASTER
          + xprint.mozdev.org release 008: XP-POSTSCRIPT, XP-PCL-COLOR,
            XP-PCL-MONO, XP-PCL-LJ3 and XP-RASTER
          + xprint.mozdev.org release >=2.0 (planned): XP-POSTSCRIPT,
            XP-PCL-COLOR, XP-PCL-MONO, XP-PCL-LJ3, XP-RASTER, XP-PDF and
            XP-SVGPRINT.
    2. There may be too many drivers loaded into one Xprt instance. By
       default a single Xserver instance can only handle three screens -
       and since one Xprint DDX maps to one Xserver screen this limit
       applies to the number of loaded Xprt drivers, too. Starting with
       xprint.mozdev.org release 008 the per-Xserver screen limit was
       increased from "3" to "8" to avoid this issue... Workaround: Start
       a 2nd instance of Xprt which handles the other drivers which do
       not fit into the first instance.

   Q:

   Printing on Solaris with Mozilla/Eclipse [or any other Xprint client]
   removes spaces between words. What is going wrong ?
   A:

   Cause:  This is a bug in the Solaris Xprint server binary
   (/usr/openwin/bin/Xprt). Various bug reports have been filed, see
     * [264]xprint.mozdev.org bug 3353 ("Solaris Xprt looses space when
       rendering with '-monotype-arial-*'-fonts")
     * [265]bugzilla.mozilla.org bug 199957 ("Solaris 8 Mozilla removes
       spaces for text within <font face="Arial">...</font>")

   Solution:  Solution: Please apply the following OS patches from
   [266]http://sunsolve.sun.com/:

   Table 1.  Solaris patches to fix [267]xprint.mozdev.org bug 3353
   ("Solaris Xprt looses space when rendering with

   [273]112786-11

Note

   For Solaris 2.7 (both SPARC and x86 platforms) there are currently
   [274]no patches available... ;-(

   Known workarounds: 
     * Remove the '-monotype-arial-*' fonts from the font path
     * Use an alternate Xprint server like available in the "GISWxprint"
       package (this package is identical to the "GISWxprintglue" package
       except that it uses a Xprint server build from xprint.mozdev.org
       sources and not the /usr/openwin/bin/Xprt binary from Solaris)
     * Mozilla-only: Adding
  user_pref("print.xprint.font.rejectfontpattern",
  "fname=-dt-.*;scalable=.*;outline_scaled=false;xdisplay=.*;xdpy=.*;ydpy=.*;xd
evice=.*|" +
  "fname=-monotype-arial.*;scalable=.*;outline_scaled=.*;xdisplay=.*;xdpy=.*;yd
py=.*;xdevice=.*");
       to prefs.js works around the problem (see
       [275]bugzilla.mozilla.org bug 199957 comment #6, too).

Note
       Note that this workaround may render various locales completly
       inaccessible for printing since many of them only employ MonoType
       fonts.

   Q:

   Installation of the "GISWxprint" / "GISWxprintglue" packages fails
   like this:
# pkgadd -d /space/staging/xprint/GISWxprint.pkg
pkgadd: ERROR: no packages were found in </var/tmp/dstreAAA5Jayyz>

   Any idea what I am doing wrong ?
   A:

   The target machine misses a patch to cure SunSolve bug 4025718
   ("pkginfo: allow greater than nine characters for PKG parameter
   value"). Please apply the patches listed in the "Installation
   Requirements" section in the README for the [276]GISWxprint /

   Q:

   Printing page results in [two/three/.../16] leading blank pages,
   followed by a correct (but offset) page. Any idea what is going wrong
   ?
   A:

   This symptom depends on the CUPS GhostScript driver used, however the
   exact cause is currently unknown (see comments in [278]SuSE support
   database entry SDB-2002/11/jsmeix_print-81-cups-formfeed ("Blank Pages
   When Printing with CUPS")).

   Solution:  Disable the CUPS accounting functionality in the cupsomatic
   filter by changing the line
  my $ps_accounting = 1;

   to
  my $ps_accounting = 0;

   in the filter script /usr/lib/cups/filter/cupsomatic as the user root.
   If you use /etc/foomatic/filter.conf, disable ps_accounting there.

          when printing using the XawPrintShell/XmPrintShell print shells
          ? 

   Q: [310]Where can I find an example how to print with Xprint using the
          OpenGL/GLX API ? 

   Q:

   How does the X print server (Xprt) and the Xlib client side differ
   from the "normal" video Xserver/video client side ?
   A:

   The X Print Service expands on the traditional X-Server and Xlib world
   in the following ways:
    1. Most obvious is the use of "print ddx drivers" instead of "video
       ddx drivers". While a video ddx driver modifies pixels in a video
       frame buffer, a print ddx driver generates "page description
       language ([311]PDL)" output (such as PCL, PDF, PostScript,
       SVGprint, etc.) or sends the print rendering instructions to a
       platform-specific print API (like Win32/GDI).
       Once a print ddx driver generates [312]PDL output, it can be sent
       to a spooler (using XpuStartJobToSpooler) or retrieved by the
       client (to implement functionality like "print-to-file" with
       functions such as XpuStartJobToFile).
    2. Since printers support "paged" output, unlike video, a portion of
       the Xp Extension supports APIs to delineate printed output into a
       print job.
       A "print job" in Xprint consists of one or more "documents" which
       itself consists of one or more "pages".
       A client starts a job sequence with XpStartJob and ends it with
       XpEndJob or XpCancelJob to cancel the generation of the current
       print job. Any document-specific print attributes MUST be changed
       before XpStartJob.
       A client starts a document sequence with XpStartDoc and ends it
       with XpEndDoc or XpCancelDoc to cancel the generation of the
       current document. Any document-specific print attributes MUST be
       changed before XpStartDoc or after XpEndDoc (to affect the
       following document).
       A client starts a page sequence with XpStartPage and ends it with
       XpEndPage or XpCancelPage to cancel the generation of the current
       page. Any page-specific print attributes MUST be changed before
       XpStartDoc or after XpEndDoc (to affect the following document).
    3. Since printers have extensive capabilities, another portion of the
       Xp Extension supports APIs to manipulate "print contexts".
       Once a printer is selected using the Xp Extension API, a print
       context to represent it can be created. A print context embodies
       the printer selected - it contains the printer's default
       capabilities, selectable range of capabilities, printer state, and
       generated output. Some "attributes" within the print context can
       be modified by the user, and the X-Server and print ddx driver
       will react accordingly. For example, the attribute
       "content-orientation" can be set to "landscape" or "portrait" (if
       the printer supports these values - which can be queried using the
       Xprint API as well).
    4. Since printers can have "built in" fonts, the Xp Extension in the
       X-Server works with the print ddx drivers to make available (for
       printing only) additional fonts on a per print context basis.
       When a print context is created and set for a given printer, the X
       font calls may be able to access additional printer fonts. To do
       this (typically), the X-Server must have access to "printer metric
       files" (.pmf) that describe at minimum the metrics of the built in
       fonts.
    5. Since printers can have "built in" fonts, the Xp Extension in the
       X-Server works with the print ddx drivers to make available (for
       printing only) additional fonts on a per print context basis.
       When a print context is created and set for a given printer, the X
       rendering calls use the resolution of the current page (or if not
       given, the resolution of the current document or the current
       resolution for this print job). The screen's resolution is INVALID
       in this case. XprintUtils has the functions XpuGetResolution (to
       get the current print resolution (searching page, document and job
       level attributes (in that order)), XpuSetPageResolution (to set
       the current page resolution), XpuSetDocResolution (to set the
       current document resolution), XpuGetResolutionList (to get the
       list of all resolutions supported by this printer) and
       XpuFindResolution (to find a resolution in the list returned by
       XpuGetResolutionList) to support getting/setting/queries of
       resolutions.
       When a print context is created and set for a given printer, the X
       image rendering calls (such as XPutImage support scaling of
       images. The Xp Extension API provides the functions
       XpSetImageResolution and XpSetImageResolution to set and get an
       image resolution. The scaling factor for an image printed on the
       paper can simply calculated via scaling_factor =
       curr_print_resolution_resolution / image_resolution where
       curr_print_resolution_resolution is the value returned by a
       function such as XpuGetResolution, image_resolution the resolution
       passed to XpSetImageResolution and scaling_factor the resulting
       scaling factor. Note that XpSetImageResolution will failure
       (=FALSE) when the print DDX (for example the RASTER DDX) does not
       support scaling. In that case the application has to scale the
       image manually.

   Q:

   How can I get the printable area (e.g. the portion of the page on
   which the printer is physically capable of placing ink) of the paper
   after I have chosen a paper ?
   A:

   The XpGetPageDimensions function returns the printable area and other
   information about the current page geometry. Note that the page
   geometry changes when the page attributes such as content-orientation
   or default-medium are changed by the application.
   Q:

   Do "offscreen" pixmaps work on Xprt ?
   A:

   Yes, "offscreen" pixmaps are working on Xprt.
   Q:

   How can I get the DPI value for the current Xprt server ? Can I use
   the values from "xdpyinfo" ?
   A:

   The Xprt screen resolution defines only the maximum resolution
   configured for the matching DDX, the printers real DPI is obtained via
   an another API (XprintUtil has a bunch of functions to get/set the
   document/page resolution, see XpuGetResolutionList,
   XpuFreeResolutionList, XpuGetResolution, XpuSetPageResolution,
   XpuSetDocResolution and XpuFindResolution).
   Q:

   Why does Xprt not offer the MIT-SHM protocol extension ?
   A:

   The MIT-SHM protocol extension is partially (XShmPutImage would work,
   but others like XShmGetImage and esp. XShmCreatePixmap cannot be
   implemented properly) incompatible to the way how some of the Xprint
   DDX are implemented. For example the PostScript, PDF, PCL and SVGprint
   DDX do not rasterize any images on their side - instead they convert
   the stream of X11 rendering instructions into the matching [313]PDL
   instruction stream. Only the printer side will (finally) do the
   rasterisation of the output image. This is the basically the same
   reason why [314]XGetImage does not work for those DDXs - and functions
   such as XShmCreatePixmap would be useless since drawing operations on
   the shared pixmap would not be applied to the application (e.g. Xprint
   client) as well.
   Q:

   Does Xprint/Xprt support font rotation ?
   A:

   Yes - Xprint/Xprt supports font rotation at any angle via the matrix
   XLFD enhancement (this even works for printer-builtin fonts !!). For
   details see the paper "New Font Technology for X11R6" by Nathan Meyers
   (a copy can be found in the Xprint.org source tree under
   xc/doc/hardcopy/XLFD/x11r6_fonts_94_paper.PS.gz)

   Short: The transformation-matrix for rotation can be calculated like
   this:
+--                    --+
| cos(angle)   sin(angle)|
|                        |
|-sin(angle)   cos(angle)|
+--                    --+

   Examples:
    1. the following code fragment obtains a 180 degree rotated font
       (matrix [-1 0 0 -1]):
  ... = XLoadQueryFont(..., "-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--*-[~24 0 0 ~24]-0-0-
m-*-iso8859-1");
    2. the following code fragment obtains a 90 degree rotated font
       (matrix [0 1 -1 0]):
  ... = XLoadQueryFont(..., "-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--*-[0 24 ~24 0]-0-0-m
-*-iso8859-1");

   Future versions of Xprint will support the [315]STSF font API which
   supports matrix transformations as well.
   Q:

   When I render something on my window and call XpStartPage all the
   rendered stuff is gone, I only get a white, empty paper. What is going
   wrong here ?
   A:

   Remember the rule that "only those drawings are printed on the paper
   which were rendered between XpStartPage and XpEndPage". XpStartPage
   clears the window you passed as argument, e.g. it creates a new, blank
   sheet of paper where you can do your rendering stuff on. XpEndpage
   then pushes the "paper sheet" to the stash of papers from the document
   in process.

Tip

   If you want to render something once for multiple or all pages: Render
   on a offscreen pixmap and copy (with XCopyArea) the content to the
   "paper" drawable (after calling XpStartPage) - XpStartpage only
   affects the window passed as parameter.

   Q:

   What is XpStartDoc for ?
   A:

   ISO 10175 and some advanced printing systems by IBM and HP had set
   forth the standard that a "Job" is made up of one or more "Documents",
   and each document is made up of one or more "Pages". Xprint was
   designed that in a true ISO 10175 environment/implementation (lp(1) on
   steroids, and with an API), Xprt can actually learn about all printers
   and their capabilities though API's into the printer subsystem (vs.
   using config files), map Job/Doc/Page directly into ISO 10175
   equivalents, and use APIs to view job status and kill jobs (vs.
   cancel(1), lpcancel(1), lpstatus(1)). Because most applications of the
   day are only printing one document per job, XpStartPage was designed
   that it generates a "synthetic" XpStartDoc if it has not been called
   yet.
   Q:

   How does the XLFD for printer-builtin fonts look like ? / How can I
   find/identify printer-builtin fonts ?
   A:

   There is no special XLFD scheme for printer-builtin fonts. Instead the
   xp-listfonts-modes-supported is used to define whether XListFonts and
   co. return printer-builtin fonts or not. By default the attribute
   looks is set to *xp-listfonts-modes-supported:
   xp-list-internal-printer-fonts xp-list-glyph-fonts which defines thaht
   XListFonts and co. return both printer-builtin and normal fonts.
   Removing xp-list-internal-printer-fonts will make printer-builtin
   fonts disappear, removing xp-list-glyph-fonts will make normal glyph
   fonts disappear from font lists.

   XXX
   Q:

   Why does the XGetImage not work for Xprt ?
   A:

   There are at least three reasons why XGetImage does not work for Xprt:
    1. Most of the Xprt DDX implementations do not render itself on any
       bitmaps like the framebuffer(=video) DDX do, they translate the
       rendering commands into the matching commands of the printer
       language (it is technically possible to implement such support for
       XGetImage even for those drivers - but there are more reasons:)
    2. Xprt usually operates at high resolutions which results in very
       large dimensions. If a client would request the 24bit TrueColor
       bitmap data for a whole DIN-A4 page at 2400 DPI a data chunk of
       ~173 megabytes would be the response. This would be more or less a
       DOS(=Denial of Service) for either the client, the network and/or
       the server.
    3. The printer-builtin fonts only provide metrics information - there
       is no real "outline" information at that time (these fonts reside
       only in the printer's ROM and are only available at the time the
       printer rasterizes the incoming [316]PDL (e.g. PCL/PostScript)
       data stream) which could be used to rasterize the matching glyphs
       (which means: A XGetImage implementation would return image data
       but glyphs rendered using the printer-builtin fonts would be
       missing).

   Q:

   How to print with Xt/Athena widgets ?
   A:

   There are two examples in the Xprint.org and X11R6.7.1 source trees
   which demonstrate how to use Xprint using Athena widgets:
    1. xc/programs/xphelloworld/xpawhelloworld/ contains a simple demo
       application which prints a Athena widget using the XawPrintShell
       widget class.
    2. xc/programs/xphelloworld/xpxthelloworld/ contains a simple demo
       application which prints a Athena widget without using a special
       print widget class (however, if possible a print shell such as
       XawPrintShell or XmPrintShell should be used since this is the
       easier way to add print support to an Athena application).

   Q:

   The XLFD for Printer-builtin fonts look like bitmap fonts - is that
   bad ?
   A:

   No, this is not "bad". The XLFD of a printer-builtin font only looks
   like a bitmap font since the *.pmf (Printer metrics file) format is a
   PCF file format variant (the DPI values in the XLFD AFAIK specifies
   the resolution which was used for generating the metrics) - however
   this does not change the fact that the printer-builtin fonts are
   outline scaleable fonts these fonts reside in the printer's ROM).
   Q:

   When printing using the XawPrintShell/XmPrintShell print shells my
   PostScript output is always corrupt. What am I doing wrong ?
   A:

   Make sure the widgets (such as text input widgets) have the (blinking)
   cursor turned-off. Setting the XmNcursorPositionVisible, to False
   usually solves the problem (for Motif2 widgets). Example:
...
XtSetArg(args[n], XmNcursorPositionVisible, False);

   XXX
   Q:

   Are there any caveats/suggestions when printing via Xt/Motif2 widgets
   ?
   A:

   There are a couple of Xt resources which may likely differ from the
   normal values (e.g. those values used for a video Xserver):

   Core class level

        XmNbackground resource
                The application will probably want to set the
                XmNbackground resource to "white" to match the default
                paper color.

        XmNborderWidth resource
                The application will probably want to set the
                XmNborderWidth resource to "0" (usually the default
                value) to avoid that a black border appears around the
                widget.

   XmPrimitive class

        XmNshadowThickness and XmNhightlightThickness resources
                The application will probably want to set
                XmNshadowThickness and XmNhightlightThickness to "0"
                (usually the default value) to avoid 3D border effects on
                the printout (depends on application and author's
                preference... :-)).

   XmText and XmTextField classes

        XmNcursorPositionVisible resource
                The application will probably want to set
                XmNcursorPositionVisible to False to avoid that the
                cursor is visible on printouts (and to avoid problems
                with some nasty implementation details which may cause
                corrupted PostScript output).

        XmNscrollHorizontal and XmNscrollVertical resources
                The application will probably want to set the
                XmNscrollHorizontal and XmNscrollVertical resources to
                False to suppress printing of scrollbars (on paper
                "scrolling" is replaced with "pagination" except for rare
                exceptions (like 1:1 WYSIWYG-printing)).

        XmNmarginWidth and XmNmarginHeight resources
                The application will probably want to recalculate the
                XmNmarginWidth and XmNmarginHeight resources based on the
                (far) higher print resolution (or reverse: set them to
                "0" - depending on what style matches the application
                needs better...).

   XmLabel class

        XmNmarginTop, XmNmarginBottom, XmNmarginRight, XmNmarginLeft,
                XmNmarginWidth, XmNmarginHeight and XmNalignment
                resources
                The application will probably want to use different value
                for XmLabel class's XmNmarginTop, XmNmarginBottom,
                XmNmarginRight, XmNmarginLeft, XmNmarginWidth,
                XmNmarginHeight and XmNalignment resources. These
                resources are mainly usefull when the widget holds a
                border, highlight or shadow of some kind. If borders are
                not to be transferred there is no real need to transfer a
                margin either.

   Q:

   Can I change the paper size/resolution/page orientation/etc. when
   printing using the XawPrintShell/XmPrintShell print shells ?
   A:

   Yes, it is allowed to change the page attributes in the page setup
   callback (e.g. XawNpageSetupCallback or XmNpageSetupCallback) since
   this callback is always called before XpStartPage (for the 2nd and
   following pages: between XpEndPage and XpStartPage). Note that
   changing page attributes will automagically update the print shell
   widget size (e.g. attributes XawNminX, XawNminY, XawNmaxX and XawNmaxX
   (XawPrintShell) or XmNminX, XmNminY, XmNmaxX and XmNmaxX
   (XmPrintShell) are updated based on events send by the Xp Extension
   and then the print shell is resized based on the new values
   (XawPrintShell is slightly more flexible since the size mode can be
   defined using the XawNlayoutMode attribute)).
   Q:

   Where can I find an example how to print with Xprint using the
   OpenGL/GLX API ?
   A:

   In Xorg release 6.7.1 Xprint support was added to the GLX demo
   application "glxgears" ([317]xc/programs/Xserver/glxgears/).

   Can I use a font server for all fonts instead of passing then directly
   to the Xprint server ?
   Does the Xprint PostScript driver do full rasterisation of the print
   job ?
   Is it possible to prepare a printer config entry so that the PS output
   is piped to "ps2pdf" and will produce directly a PDF file? It would be
   nice to have mozilla directly producing PDF files when printing.
   Problem: I have changed the Xprt config - but "xplsprinters -l"
   (or any other Xprint application) does not show the change.
   Any idea what I am doing wrong ?
   How can I add a font path to Xprt ?
   Why does "xset +fp path_to_font" not work in some cases ?
   How can I get a "core"-dump when Xprt crashes ?
   How can I debug Xprt (hint: use "-audit 4") ?
   How can I debug Xprt with Sun Workshop (hint: "check -access") ?
   How can I check whether Xprint is "active" ? / How can I verify that a
   Xprint is working ?
